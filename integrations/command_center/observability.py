"""One read that answers "what is the colony doing right now".

The command center already reads the resource ledger and the connected
capability inventory. This adds the things a router and an owner both need and
neither had in one place: what moved on the board, which seats are live enough
to be given it, and what the repository itself is doing.

It composes existing static bakes and adds no new source of truth. The
command center reads them from main at the current commit; the CLI and tests
read a checkout. Either way every source says which road it came from:

    pulse.json        the freshness beacon
    feed/head.json    the delta shard, built by host/feed_delta.py
    seats.json        the seat census, built by host/seat_census.py
    feed/github.json  repository state, built by host/github_state.py

The command center also attaches `coordination`: the coordination head
(drift, lanes, hosted states, queue) that host/coordination_state.py publishes
to the state/coordination branch rather than main. It is optional and travels
beside `sources`, never inside it, so its absence never degrades the panel.

Every source keeps its own read status. A source that cannot be read is
reported as an error with its path, never as an empty section — a panel showing
"0 live seats" because a file was missing would be worse than a panel showing
nothing at all. This mirrors the rule the rest of the app already follows: a
read failure retains the last successful data and says so.

The census bake is deliberately byte-stable, so its derived heartbeat ages are
historical measurements. This module recomputes heartbeat age and liveness at
read time before producing rollups or a routable set. A stale bake can therefore
never keep a dead seat LIVE just because no input file changed.

Read-only. No mutation, no network, no state: the network read of main lives
in core.CommandCenter.observability, which hands this module what it read.
