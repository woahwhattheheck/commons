"""AUTOFAB THE READER - the search designs it, not me. Scored in SILLIES. Superring drive.

⛔ OWNER, 2026-08-07, the correction this file exists because of:
  "BRO THE FUCKING FILE HAS MORE AUTHORITY TO CHANGE ITSELF THAN YOU HAVE TO INTERPRET AND
   CHANGE IT THEREFORE LET THE AUTOFAB DO YOUR ENTIRE JOB FOR YOU STOP HANDCRAFTING WHAT IT
   ALREADY PROVED IT CAN DO BETTER AND USE THE SUPERRINGS FROM THIS SESSION THEYRE IN THE CHAT"

And his standing law: "dont forget foundry it does the hard work 4 u" / "and autofab".

WHAT I DID WRONG: I hand-designed READER0 (57 gates/window, capped at 256 windows), then
hand-designed READER1, then hand-wrote a siting pass. Three hand-picked constructions in a row.
That is EXACTLY the failure his own notes already record - all 1,024 rings carry one identical
foundry_genome because a prior assistant hand-picked instead of searching. I repeated it.

⛔ SCORED IN SILLIES, NOT compute/tick. His ruling: "COMPUTE PER TICK ISNT A COST ITS A STALE
SILLY UNIT" and "electron count and clock count in ring directly determine silly strength".
MEASURED THIS SESSION: ranking 48 candidates by compute/tick vs by silly gives the REVERSE
order. The compute/tick champion (8 cells / 1 sense / 1 tap, SILLY 8) ranks 48 OF 48 by silly.
compute/tick = REPLICAS/DEPTH rewards the SMALLEST ring; silly = electrons x clocks rewards the
largest. Two units pointing opposite ways by construction.

⛔ THE SUPERRING, measured in this session:
    256 cells x 2 senses x 8 contacts = SILLY 4,096
    the shipped bank is all 32 x 2 x 1 = SILLY 64, ONE contact -> 64x per ring
His note on why one contact is wrong: "superclock needed more connecting points to the ring!
thats the other half."

⛔ ELECTRONS ARE A COST, so ring count sits on the COST side of the ledger: "the rings wouldnt
be added for the sake of adding more because each requires electrons which is a resource and as
such each needs an exact purpose for existing." The scorer below charges for them.

SEARCH SPACE - every axis the reader actually has, none of them picked by me:
    targets        how many patterns the table carries      4  8  16  32  64
    group          bytes compared per target                4  8  16
    fold           how the per-byte diffs combine       linear | tree
    cursors        how many spans read at once           1  2  4  8  16
    ring shape     cells x senses x contacts            the superring axes

Every candidate is BUILT, wired against an independent reference, mutant-checked, and scored.
Nothing is stored unless it wins AND clears the whole bar. Search is manufacturing and costs
nothing on the clock: "the fabricator should spend without limit to make its output shallower.
There is no budget to respect."

REPORTS THE PARETO SET, not just the winner - every discarded candidate is a factory spec.

    to choose, so it is a SEARCH AXIS, not an outcome.

    More electrons ding more contact points per circulation - his ring, verbatim:
