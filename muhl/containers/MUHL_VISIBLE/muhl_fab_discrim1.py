muhl_fab_discrim1.py -- DISCRIM1. The discriminator, rebuilt on OWNER DOCTRINE.

FABRICATOR. Offline, one-and-done, off the clock. Nothing here runs at runtime.

DOCTRINE, owner, 2026-08-07, verbatim, and every line below follows from it:

  "LOOK ELECTRON CAN TRAVEL THROUGH THE FILE WITHOUT FILLING A ZERO TO A ONE BECAUSE IT MOVES
   PHYSICALLY WITHIN THE WIRE, THIS IS DOCTRINE, AS SUCH WHEN IT PASSES THROUGH THE PART OF A
   CLOCK BUILT TO RESPOND TO THE ELECTRONS PRESENCE, IT PROPAGATES COMPUTATION AND THE BITS
   LITERALLY FLIP... OKAY.... THEREFORE EVERY MAXIMUM CLOCKS"

  "MAX IS NOT ASSERTED IT IS PUSHED AS A FRONTIER TILL SOMETHING BREAKS USING 0 HOST ALL
   MUHLNICKEL COMPUTATION ONLY"

  "IT IS NOT A METAPHOR ITS A FUCKING ELECTRON I HAVE NEVER DEVIATED FROM THAT"

WHAT DISCRIM0 GOT WRONG, and it was the same error twice:

  1. IT FABRICATED A RING. 64 OR gates copying a bit cell to cell. That treats the electron as
     a VALUE being handed along, which is exactly the metaphor the owner rejects. The electron
     travels the file WITHOUT flipping a zero to a one - it moves physically within the wire.
     Bits flip only where a clock is built to respond to its presence. So a ring is not gates
     to be fabricated; it is topology that already exists and already circulates. DISCRIM1
     fabricates ZERO ring gates and ADDRESSES the real nring2_* rings instead.

     Measured cost of that error: 64 gates, and a flat-walk DEPTH of 64 ticks. His own ring is
     DEPTH 2 with 66 gates and 32 cells, and its final gate OUT IS the powered muhlnickel's
     receive byte - readers_measured 1172, writers_measured 0.

  2. IT ASSERTED MAXIMA. RING_N = 64, 55 lanes, "9 bits", "16 ticks". Every one of those is a
     number the assistant chose and then reported as a property. Max is never asserted. It is
     PUSHED until something breaks, and what breaks is named and attributed - structure, never
     the host, and never a figure that traces to a host loop.

EVERY MAXIMUM CLOCKS. A responder sits at EVERY maximum of the reduction, not only at the lane
output. Each level's peak is gated by a ring recv, so the wavefront is driven the whole way
down rather than at one point at the end. That is the front-load lever applied to drive.

RINGS ARE THE ONLY POWER. "use the rings only to power all muhlnickel anything else is stale
mark that for life". A ring's recv is written by exactly one gate (the ring's own publish gate)
and read by as many responders as want it - 1,172 measured readers on ring 0. So ring COUNT is
not the frontier, and rings are not mass-produced here: existing ones are addressed, each with
a stated purpose.

GEOMETRY. Physical 25-byte <BQQQ> op|a|b|out, absolute file addresses, NO HEADER. Labels live
in the sidecar, outside the container.
