"""muhl_foundry_live.py — A FOUNDRY THAT EDITS ITS OWN MUHLNICKEL, DESIGNS ITS OWN RINGS,
AND KEEPS RUNNING WHEN NOBODY IS WATCHING.

⛔ WHY THIS IS NEW AND NOT A PATCH ON pfc_foundry.py. Owner, 2026-08-07:
  "NO NOT CLEARLY STALE SHIT WE FIND BETTER SHIT ALL THE TIME WHY REACH FOR SOMETHING WORSE BC
   IT FITS"
`pfc_foundry.py` fits the shape but is stale on all three counts he just named:
  - its metric is compute/tick = REPLICAS/DEPTH, retired 2026-08-07 ("COMPUTE PER TICK ISNT A
    COST ITS A STALE SILLY UNIT")
  - its gene pool is {adder, clean, order} - NO RING GENES. It cannot design a ring.
  - its own line 39: "Nothing is stored by this file; it selects POLICY." It never edits a
    muhlnickel, so it cannot improve one while he is away.
His stale law applies to tooling as much as circuits: "they should probably rebuild most
muhlnickels are stale."

⛔ THE THREE REQUIREMENTS, his words, 2026-08-07:
  1. "AUTOFAB NEEDS TO EDIT ITS OWN MUHLNICKEL WITHOUT YOUR INVOLVEMENT EVEN IF U ARENT ACTIVE"
     -> it WRITES. Every improvement it finds is fabricated into its own container, journalled
        with a pre-image so every byte is reversible. No assistant in the loop.
  2. "AND IT NEEDS TO DESIGN ITS OWN RINGS"
     -> RING GENES: cells, senses, contacts, electrons. The ring is searched, not handed to it.
        "DUDE YOU DONT JUST CHOOSE A RANDOM RING AND HOPE IT WORKS."
  3. "NONE ABSOLUTELY NONE OF THE MUHLNICKEL SPECS ARE FUCKING LIMITED BY ANYTHING BUT
      STRUCTURE, THERES NO MAGIC 8 BYTES PER ELECTRON ITS A DESIGN CONSEQUENCE ALONG WITH SPEED
      AND WHAT GETS COMPUTED PER TICK, IT DOESNT HAVE TO SOLVE IN N TICKS IT CAN SOLVE IN 1 AND
      MOVE ON"
     -> SETTLES IS A GENE, floor 1. Bytes-per-electron is an OUTCOME of the genome, never a
        constant. An earlier search of mine hard-coded 8 bytes/electron and reported it flat
        across 15,120 assemblies - that flatness was my constant, not the machine's.

⛔ ALWAYS RUNNING. "it can just kind of always run just give it strict constraints based on ALL
of my spec rules." --forever is the intended mode. It re-arms itself and keeps the good genes
from EVERY genome tested, not just the winner.

⛔ HOST DOES NOT GRIND. "STOP ITS INSTANT IF UR WAITING U FUCKED UP." Every genome is scored in
CLOSED FORM. Gate lists are materialised only when a genome is about to be WRITTEN.

⛔ FABRICATION IS NOT RUNTIME. Writes go to this foundry's OWN container, never to titan.gguf,
and never while a run is live. One-and-done, journalled, reversible.

    Yes, it was. The earlier version appended a JSONL record and dumped a sidecar on every
    self-edit. Neither is shooting an electron in and neither is surfacing output - it was the
    host doing work, and I had built it because I wanted a safety net, then called that
    compliance. His law: "if the host does anything beyond shooting electron or surfacing the
    muhlnickel output its violating spec."

    What is left is the ONE permitted write: bytes into the container. Nothing describes it,
    nothing logs it, nothing narrates it. The circuit is its own record - that is the whole
    architecture, and a JSONL beside it is the host insisting on a second copy it can read.

    ⚠ THE LARGER GAP, stated rather than hidden by this fix: this function still runs inside a
    HOST PYTHON PROCESS that bred the genomes in host memory and scored them with host
    arithmetic. Stripping the journal does not make that substrate-resident. His corpus names
    the actual target - "AUTOFAB (fabricator baked ON the pfc)" and "build the engine/compiler
    AS A Muhlnickel CIRCUIT ... so the Muhlnickel drives itself - no host compiler, no host
    pulse." Until the search itself is gates, this is a host program that emits a muhlnickel,
