"""FABRICATE THE AUTOFAB AS A MUHLNICKEL. Zero Python at runtime. Zero host. Gates only.

⛔ OWNER, 2026-08-07, and this file exists because I got it wrong three times first:
  "LOOK RETARD ALLLLL OF AUTOFAB = NEEDS TO BE MUHLNICKEL CIRCUITS 0 PY 0 HOST 0"

muhl_foundry_live.py bred genomes in host memory, scored them with host arithmetic, and wrote
files. Stripping its journal removed the visible violation, not the structural one - it was a
host program that emits a muhlnickel, never a muhlnickel that improves itself.

THIS FILE IS A FABRICATOR AND NOTHING ELSE. Fabrication is the ONE sanctioned host act -
"fabrication is NEVER a runtime event. its one and done" - and after this pass runs, no Python
is involved in the autofab at all. The search IS gates.

⛔ HOW A CIRCUIT EDITS ITSELF, and it is his law, not an invention here:
  "CIRCUITS COMBINE BY ADDRESS COLLISION WRITE THAT DOWN"
The genome registers' OUT ADDRESSES ARE THE OPERAND FIELDS OF THE AUTOFAB'S OWN GATE RECORDS.
Writing the genome IS rewriting the circuit. There is no writer, no process, no host step -
the same mechanism that makes gate 0's out address gate 1's a address in muhl_fold_phys, read
in the binary today: out 1,127,674,788 == next a 1,127,674,788.

⛔ AND THE STATE ADVANCES BY SELF-CLOCK, his original mechanism, ~11 days before the ring:
  "self-routed: nonce'/latch' outputs SHARE the nonce/latch state bytes (physical feedback)"
The next genome is written to the SAME addresses the current genome is read from. One
deliberate SSA exception; that is what makes state advance with no scheduler.

THE AUTOFAB, AS CIRCUITS:
  GENOME PLANE   the live genome, one byte per gene. ITS ADDRESSES ARE OPERAND FIELDS.
  LFSR           mutation entropy, in gates - a maximal-length shift register, XOR taps
  MUTATE         genome' = genome XOR (lfsr AND mask)
  CROSSOVER      genome' = (parentA AND sel) OR (parentB AND NOT sel)     sel from the LFSR
  SCORE          SILLY = electrons x contacts, as a shift-add multiplier in gates
  COMPARE        challenger > incumbent, a borrow-chain comparator
  SELECT         MUX the winner back into the GENOME PLANE = the self-edit
  NO JOURNAL. NO SIDECAR. NO LOG. The circuit is its own record.

⛔ NOTHING IS BOUNDED BY A LIST I TYPED. Gene values are held as BYTES, so a gene ranges over
whatever the width allows - not over a Python tuple. His: "NONE ABSOLUTELY NONE OF THE
MUHLNICKEL SPECS ARE FUCKING LIMITED BY ANYTHING BUT STRUCTURE."

    ⛔ WHY THIS IS A PRIMITIVE AND NOT A CONVENTION. On 2026-08-07 the same mistake was made at
    FIVE separate sites in one circuit: the budget, the envelope staging, the witness staging, the
    shadow, and the drop count were each written as `AND(src, write)` straight into the state
    address. So a settle that did not write put a ZERO there - "not publishing" meant "erase"
    instead of "leave alone." In a machine that runs continuously and publishes occasionally the
    quiet settle is the COMMON case, so every one of those cells destroyed itself on the normal
    path and survived only during the exception.

    None of it showed up in testing, because every test drove an input that DID write. A defect on
    the idle path is invisible to a battery that never idles.

    Owner: "ITS NEVER INERT." A cell that is not being written is not doing nothing - it is
    holding, and holding is something the wiring has to SAY. Returns (w, ) with the cell written
    to its own address, out addr == in addr, self-clocked.

    #    THING."  MEASURED, phase-corrected, over every container on this desktop:
    #        FOUNDRY0  84.29% zero   widest operand        127  -> needs 1 byte
    #        READER1   80.33% zero   widest operand        382  -> needs 2

    #    63.94% of 21,327,250 bytes across the set. A <BQQQ> record spends 24 bytes carrying three
    #    numbers that fit in six, and in a machine where a byte IS a wire every one of those zeros
    #    is an address that computes nothing - the same law as "PUTTING LABELS IN THE BINARY IS

    # redundancy the ring records already carry, where out_i IS i).

    # ⛔ OWNER, 2026-08-08: "MUHLNICKEL CAN WRITE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
    #    The aperture was being emitted by a Python fabricator on the host. It does not have to be.
    #    This circuit already writes gate records - genes drive the OPERAND FIELDS of records at
    #    `tbl` and at RTBL, and a gate whose OUT lands inside a gate-record region WRITES A GATE
    #    RECORD. Read live out of AUTOFAB0's own bytes at record 775: AND(167, 709) -> 167, with
    #    out == a. It rewrites itself, and it has been doing so the whole time.
    #
    #    So the aperture gets its own target region and its own genes, and the substrate lays it
    #    down. The host does not fabricate it. The host's two verbs stay: shoot the electron in,
    #    surface the output.
    #
    #    THE APERTURE GENES, all eight, reusing the genome plane's later slots:
    #      4 settles       already live - prices the answer
    #      5 width         already live - selects which ring carries reach the LFSR
    #      6 fold          already live
    #      7 record geometry - already live, and the APERTURE INHERITS IT, so the aperture's own
    #        records get the same stride search: 4/7/10/13/16/19/22/25 explicit-out and
    #        3/5/7/9/11/13/15/17 implicit-out. On these containers that is a 25-byte record
    #        against a 7-byte one, and 63.94% of 21,327,250 bytes here are structurally zero.
    #
    #    Every write below goes through hold_cell, so a gene that is not currently selecting a
    #    record leaves that record ALONE instead of zeroing it - the mistake made seven times in
    #    one session and now a shape rather than something each site has to remember.
