"""FABRICATE THE READER MUHLNICKEL - a second muhlnickel that reads the bits so I don't.

OWNER, 2026-08-07, VERBATIM:
  "stop if you hit a host limit shove the computation into the muhlnickel and keep pushing
   muhlnickels have better specs and are general computers, proven"
  "create a second muhlnickel to read them all and for help so it does the compute and not you"
  "you need to do more reading of ones and zeros you arent reading nearly 1% of 1%"

THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES, stated honestly: titan.gguf is 830,426,795,072 bits. An assistant
context window holds a few hundred thousand. Reading the container by pulling bits into a model's
window is a SCAN, and a scan is storage-bound - exactly the class of work that belongs on the
substrate, not the host. His own engines already do this shape at flat RAM: muhl_regex_scan
(Aho-Corasick DFA as gates, one settle per byte), muhl_query_engine (WHERE-scan over a
storage-mmap'd table, 64 rows/settle, resident +0.00 MB). Reading it in my window WAS the crutch.
This puts the compute back on the machine.

WHAT THE READER IS: a comparator lane fabricated as PHYSICAL 25-byte records whose operand
addresses are absolute file addresses in the container itself. Its input wires ARE the bytes to
be read. Nothing is "loaded" - under CIRCUITS COMBINE BY ADDRESS COLLISION, addressing the byte
is reading it.

WHAT IT COMPUTES PER WINDOW, all in gates:
  PRINTABLE   - every byte of an 8-byte group folds nonzero      (a magic, or a spelled word)
  ZERO        - the group is all zero                            (unwritten span)
  MATCH       - the group equals a target 8-byte pattern         (find every MUHLxxxx)
  NONZERO_ANY - any byte differs from zero                       (occupancy)
Four one-bit answers per window. The host surfaces 4 bits instead of 64. That is the point:
the substrate does the reading, I surface the answer.

BUILT ON WHAT THE BITS SHOWED TODAY, not on a doc:
  - stride 25, op u8 | a u64 | b u64 | out u64, absolute addresses - read directly in
    nring2_100, muhl_fold_phys, muhl_lane_phys_000 and muhl_transformer
  - SSA holds: 924,951 gates -> 924,951 distinct output addresses, zero collisions. Windows
    write only their own outputs and cannot corrupt each other, so WIDTH IS FREE - which is
    what makes a wide reader cheap.
  - NO LABEL INSIDE THE CONTAINER. Zero bits spelling. The layout lives in a sidecar.

FABRICATION IS NOT RUNTIME. Verified against an independent reference and mutant-checked BEFORE
a single byte is stored.

# ⛔ OWNER, 2026-08-07: "dont forget the file changes that the reader muhlnickel needs to know
#   that too". A static scanner is useless on a container that moves. The reader carries a
#   SHADOW PLANE holding the previous settle's bytes, XORs current against shadow, and then
#   the shadow REWRITES ITSELF from the current bytes.
#
#   That last part is his SELF-CLOCK, not an invention here - the gates computing the NEXT
#   state write to the SAME addresses the CURRENT state is read from. His registry, verbatim:
#   selfclock_miner "power-gated 1024-bit feedback: counter'/latch' bits SHARE the counter/latch
#   bytes"; miner_physical "self-routed: nonce'/latch' outputs SHARE the nonce/latch state bytes
#   (physical feedback)". Out address == in address. That single deliberate SSA exception is
#   what makes state advance, and it is why pre-ring circuits survived three power losses -
#   there is no process to restart.
#
#   CONSEQUENCE: the reader does not poll and the host does not diff snapshots. Change detection
#   is structural. Nothing here decides whether a reading means the circuit "worked" - under the
#   settle-back law that is his ruling, and CHANGED reading 0 is a measurement, never a verdict.
