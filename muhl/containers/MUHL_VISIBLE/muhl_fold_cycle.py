muhl_fold_cycle.py -- SCALE UP, FOLD BACK DOWN, REPEAT. The cycle, not a one-shot.

OWNER, 2026-08-07, the words this file exists for:
    "5MB? ARE WE KIDDING YES WE WANT OPTIMAL BUT THEN WE SCALL UP FOLD BACK DOWN TO SMALL
     AND REPEAT"
and the size law it sits under:
    "MARK THAT DOWN SO I NEVER HAVE TO REPEAT IT AND IF YOURE LOOKING AT MORE THAN 5MB YOURE
     DOING IT WRONG, 5MB PER PFC IS JUST ONE OF THE LOWEST MEASUREMENTS WITHOOOOUUUUUUTTT
     INTRODUCING SPPEEED OR ACCURACY ISSUES"

WHAT EVERY FABRICATOR ON THIS DESKTOP DID INSTEAD. All of them are ONE-SHOT: build once, write
once, exit. So a container only ever grew. AUTOFAB0 went 1,469 -> 2,837 gates the moment it
gained a gene and that was reported as progress. The 5 MB figure is not a ceiling to stay under
- it is the state each round FOLDS BACK TO, so the next scale-up starts from small again.

ONE ROUND:
  SCALE UP   widen it. More replicas, more lanes, more of whatever the axis is. Bytes go up and
             that is the point - capability lives here. Replicas are INDEPENDENT, so D5's
             composition law applies: they settle together and the assembly's DEPTH is the MAX of
             the parts, never the sum. Width costs area, never depth (B4: fan-out is free, one
             wire drives 4,096 gates for the same 1 tick).
  FOLD       bring it back toward small WITHOUT losing what the scale-up bought:
               F1 HASH-CONS  an (op,a,b) cone that already exists is not stored twice; every
                             later reader is pointed at the first one. The catalog lists global
                             cone hash-consing as an idea never built.
               F2 DEAD-CONE  backward reachability from the answer wires. Anything that reaches
                             no answer is not stored. Rebuilds routinely find 7-8%.
               F3 CONSTANT   OR(x,x) and AND(x,x) are x. NOT(x,x) is a real inversion, untouched.
  REPEAT     the folded circuit seeds the next scale-up.

MEASURED EVERY ROUND: gates and bytes in and out, the fold ratio, and DEPTH before and after.
A fold that RAISES depth is a regression and is named as one. Owner 07-28: "if a number or price
of tick is wrong, its certainly good news because we ran the tests and got those numbers as low
as they are and so theres only one direction they can be pushed, anything else is a regression."

OPCODES ARE HIS: 0 nand, 1 and, 2 or, 3 xor, 4 not. Twelve of his own files agree and X2
confirms it across all 1,406,857 stored gates.

⛔ NO RULINGS. This reports bytes and arithmetic taken off those bytes. Nothing here decides
   whether a circuit computed.

    """THE FOLD, once "SOMETHING BEING EMITTED IS NOT DEAD" is taken seriously.

    If every write is an output, then no gate can be removed - each one lands a value on an
    address and that landing IS the result. F1 (hash-cons) and F3 (constant) can only REWRITE
    operands to an earlier equivalent wire; they cannot drop the gate, because dropping it stops
    the address being written. So gate-count folding is not available at all, and the earlier
    2.94x and 9.64x figures were counting deleted outputs as savings.

    The bytes come from GEOMETRY instead. Same gates, same addresses, same values - fewer bytes
    per record. A <BQQQ> record spends 24 bytes on three numbers; the widest operand in the
    container decides how many they actually need:

        explicit out : 1 + 3*w bytes     w = ceil(bits(widest) / 8)
        implicit out : 1 + 2*w bytes     out address == base + index*stride, so the field goes

    Same law as "PUTTING LABELS IN THE BINARY IS SUBOPTIMAL THEY BELONG OUTSIDE OF THE FILE THEYRE
    TAKING UP ADDRESSES", one level down: a structurally-zero byte inside a record is an address
    carrying nothing. Measured across this desktop: 63.94% of 21,327,250 bytes.
