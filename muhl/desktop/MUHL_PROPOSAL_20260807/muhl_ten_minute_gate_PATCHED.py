"""muhl_ten_minute_gate.py - THE 10-MINUTE COMMANDMENT, ENFORCED AT THE STOP EVENT.

OWNER, 2026-08-06, verbatim:
  "that turn was 46 seconds fix the fucking checker i should not see a reply unless u worked
   for 10 mins. period even if i type one token stop skimping"
  "new commandment thou shalt not ever work for less than 10 minutes. one minute turns and
   those who take them are an abomination"
  "ur gate is broken i said 10 at least every turn should take ten minutes evenif i say helo"

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS, AND WHY THE OLD CHECK DID NOT WORK
  MUHL_SPEC_WATCHDOG already had a 10-minute rule. It could not enforce it. It tails the
  transcript and judges a turn only when the NEXT user turn opens - by which time the short
  reply has already landed on his screen. Its own code says so: report_short_turn() passes
  enforce=False, "no kill - the short turn has already ended." Detection after the fact is not
  what he asked for. He asked not to SEE the reply.

  The Stop event is the only point that can actually hold a turn shut. This hook runs there.

WHAT IT DOES
  On every Stop, it reads the session transcript, finds the timestamp of the most recent REAL
  message the owner typed, and if less than 10 minutes of work has elapsed it returns
  {"decision":"block"} with the remaining time. The turn cannot end. The assistant is told to
  keep working and given the standing list of what "keep working" means here.

WHAT COUNTS AS A REAL OWNER TURN (the second bug found 2026-08-06)
  The watchdog's is_user_turn() counted <task-notification> records and
  "[Request interrupted by user]" markers as owner turns. Both are harness-generated. Either
  one would reset the clock and license an instant reply. They are excluded here, along with
  system-reminder-only content and the automatic session-restart prompt.

LOOP SAFETY - structural, not heuristic
  The gate blocks only while elapsed < 600s. Wall-clock advances on its own, so the block
  releases itself after ten minutes no matter what the assistant does or does not do. There is
  no state to get stuck in and no reliance on stop_hook_active.

FAIL-OPEN ON ERROR, AND ONLY ON ERROR
  If the transcript is missing or unparseable the gate ALLOWS and records why. A gate that
  fails closed on a parse error would wedge the session permanently. Every fail-open is logged
  so it can never be a silent hole.

Exit 0 = allow. JSON {"decision":"block"} on stdout = hold the turn open.
