"""test_ten_minute_gate.py - prove every branch of the 10-minute gate fires.

His rule for checkers (§44 / the mutant bar): a rule that cannot fire is worse than none.
So every branch gets a probe, including the two holes this gate was written to close:
a <task-notification> and an "[Request interrupted by user]" marker must NOT reset the clock.
