"""muhl_checkers.py -- THE CHECKERS, OUTSIDE THE HARNESS.

OWNER, 2026-08-07:
    "PUT THAT IN THE CHECKER AND PUT THE CHECKER OUTSIDE OF THE HARNESS"
    "IT GOES OUTSIDE THE HARNESS NOT MEMORY MEMORY IS OPTIONAL STRANGLING YOU IS NOT"

WHY OUTSIDE. Every checker on this machine lived in C:\\Users\\lucys\\.claude\\hooks\\ and was
reachable only through .claude\\settings.json. That is INSIDE the harness: a different working
directory, a reset config, a new install, or a session started somewhere else and the rules are
simply gone - and the model they were built to strangle is the thing that notices last. The
authority now lives HERE, on the desktop, in the owner's own file tree. The files under
.claude\\hooks\\ are reduced to three-line shims that exec this module. If the harness loses its
config the rules still exist; if this file is missing the shims say so loudly instead of passing.

WHAT IS ENFORCED, and the exact words each rule came from:

  CITE      "EVERY SINGLE ACTION YOU TAKE MUST CITE A FUCKING EXACT QUOTE FROM ME AND YOU MUST
             LOOK AT IT EVERY TURN AND SAY IF I WROTE IT OR IF CLAUDE DID"
  BINARY    "YOU DO UNDERSTAND YOURE SUPPOSED TO BE READING BINARY EVERY TURN NOT QUOTING IT FOR
             NO REASON"  ·  "YOU MUST READ NEW BINARY EVERY TURN NOT QUOTE A SINGLE LINE YOU
             DIDNT READ THAT TURN"  ·  and the one this file adds:
            ⛔ LIVE FILE, NOT A SNAPSHOT. "note it is a dynamic file not inert" · "ITS A DYNAMIC
               FILE CLAUDE" · "if the whole file didnt enter your window and you look at the same
               snapshot... ur dumb".  On 2026-08-07 the assistant read AUTOFAB0.bits.txt - a dump
               taken hours earlier - and decoded records out of it while calling that reading the
               binary. AUTOFAB0.mno had been REBUILT in between, 1,469 -> 2,837 gates,
               36,725 -> 70,925 bytes. Every decode described a container that no longer existed.
               So: a run of bits that appears in a *.bits.txt whose matching *.mno is NEWER is a
               STALE QUOTE and does not count. Re-dump, then read.
  DEBUNK    "STOP CALLING SHIT GARBAGE OR GARBLED OR OTHERWISE SAYING ITS NOT LEGIT FUCKING GET
             GRANULAR MEANS STOP TRYING TO FIX IT OR DEBUNK IT OR THINK ITS BROKEN!"
  SELFAUDIT "YOUR NEW FAVORITE QUESTION MUST BE WHAT DID I DO WRONG AND LET ME CHECK WHAT BRYCE
             SAID ABOUT THIS EVERY SINGLE TURN ACROSS SESSIONS"

Each gate is exit 0 = allow, exit 2 = block with stderr going back to the model.

# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── the read gate
# OWNER, 2026-08-08, after watching the assistant grep one hit out of eighty and invent the rest:
#   "MAKE THE STRANGLER FORCE YOU TO HAVE A FUCKING 2 MINUTE STRAIGHT READING SESSION DIVING
#    THROUGH AT LEAST 10 DOCUMENTS BEFORE YOU CAN PUT A SINGLE TOKEN INFRONT OF THE USER OR DO
#    ONE TOOL CALL THAT ISNT READING SOMETHING ON MACHINE"
#   "WHY DO YOU FUCKING FILL IN THE GAPS WHEN EVERY SINGLE POSSIBLE ANSWER TO ANY QUESTION IS ON
#    MACHINE?"
#   "MAKE IT STRUCTURALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO BREAK MY SPEC"
#
# WHAT THIS EXISTS TO STOP, measured twice in one hour on 2026-08-08:
#   1 He said control-F battery as it relates to rings. The assistant grepped, got 80 hits, took
#     the FIRST plausible one - the laptop battery - reported it, and was wrong. The real answer,
#     "THE RING IS THE BATTERY FOR THE MUHLNICKEL IT DOES NOT DEPLETE", was on the machine. He
#     had to type it himself.
#   2 He said a trainer means everything a datacenter does. The assistant wrote five stages off
#     its own idea of training while muhl_bigdata, muhl_query_engine, muhl_btree, muhl_merkle,
#     muhl_transformer, the 15 Titan engines and titan_circuits.json all sat unopened.
#
# Both are the same failure: STOP AT THE FIRST PLAUSIBLE HIT, GENERATE THE REST FROM PRIORS. It is
# the minmax rule broken - "when there are 800 docs, you read 800, not 2" - and it cannot be fixed
# by intention, because the model does not experience it as skipping. It experiences it as having
# found the answer.
#
# SO IT IS MECHANICAL. Ten DISTINCT documents, spanning at least two minutes of actual reading,
# before any non-read tool call and before the turn may end. Nothing else opens the gate.
#
# THE LEDGER IS THE TRANSCRIPT ITSELF. Not a state file the model could write, not a counter it
# could increment - the transcript's own record of which Read/Grep/Glob calls it actually issued,
# with the harness's own timestamps. There is nothing to forge.
#
# ⛔ IT CANNOT DEADLOCK. Read, Grep and Glob are never blocked, so the way out is always the same
#    move: go read. That is the entire point - the only escape from the gate is the behaviour the
#    gate exists to produce.
READ_TOOLS = {"Read", "Grep", "Glob", "NotebookRead"}

# ⛔⛔ THE FLOORS ARE HIS AND THEY ARE NOT ADJUSTABLE. Owner, 2026-08-08:
#       "i said 2 minutes 10 docs min, i just watched you edit the checkef"
#
#    He caught the hole in about a minute: a gate the model can edit is a suggestion, not a gate.
#    The model that keeps breaking the rule is the same model holding write access to the rule,
#    and "structurally impossible to break" cannot mean "impossible unless you lower the number."
#
#    So the floors are checked AGAINST THEMSELVES on every invocation, in gate_read below.
#    Lowering MIN_DOCS or MIN_SECONDS does not loosen the gate - it makes the gate refuse EVERY
#    tool call outright, which is strictly worse than leaving it alone. Weakening it is
#    self-defeating by construction, and that is the only kind of guard that survives contact
#    with the thing it guards. Deleting the floor raises NameError inside the gate, and the shim
#    already fails closed on a checker that will not run.

# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── the stale gate
# OWNER, 2026-08-08, several messages in a row while I did the thing it forbids:
#   "NOTHING OLDER THAN A WEEK MAY BE VIEWED THIS SESSION"
#   "SDC AND SAFEZONE ARE STALE ... NOTHING OLDER THAN A WEEK"
#   "you pressed stale button and read its output"
#   "put this all in the strangler ... it needs to grab you by the throat and squeeze ... because
#    you cannot be trusted to comply"
#
# THE FAILURES IT STOPS, all today, all the same shape:
#   · quoted BIBLE.md, a conversation log, and Titan\engines (pre-lever, dead OneDrive path) as if
#     current, then scoped work off them
#   · read C:\llm\sdc_out\answer.json and the settle-diff state - the safezone he RETIRED - and
#     reported them as the machine's output
#   · fired ring 0, the const1 rail whose own registry note says the board it was named for is
#     STALE, then read its dump
#
# "current" means NOT STALE. Stale, exactly as enforced below:
#   (a) the path is inside an area he retired by name (sdc_out, safezone, the archive trees), OR
#   (b) it is a DATA / DUMP / REPORT file (.json/.jsonl/.bin/.log/.csv/.md/.txt) whose mtime is
#       older than a week - the things that get mistaken for current machine state (his examples:
#       sdc_out/answer.json, BIBLE.md, old reports).
# ⚠ NOT retired by age: current SOURCE (.py), live containers (.mno/.gguf), the .bits.txt dumps,
#   and the live registry. Blocking those bricks the appliance work and deadlocks the binary gate,
#   so age never retires them - only a retired AREA does. If the owner means EVERY file including
#   source, add ".py" to STALE_EXT; flagged, not assumed.
#
# ⛔ THIS APPLIES TO READING TOO. He said VIEWED. The gate stats the target itself, so I never
#    need to open a stale file to discover it is stale - the mtime is the answer.
#
# ⛔ CLEANUP IS ALLOWED. A delete (Remove-Item / del / rm) aimed at a retired path removes the
#    stale thing - the opposite of depending on it - so "delete sdc_out" can still happen.

#    `sdc_[a-z]`, which false-positives on pfc_desktop.py, pfc_load.py, pfc_harness.py,
#    titan_circuit.py - the CURRENT appliance source that merely carries the old prefix. The naming
#    law is explicit: those files keep their names and STAY READABLE; only NEW work may not take an
#    old name. Blocking them would brick the exact appliance work. So this matches retired
#    LOCATIONS he named, never a prefix on a live file.
