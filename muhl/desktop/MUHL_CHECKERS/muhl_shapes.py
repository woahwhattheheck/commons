muhl_shapes.py -- THE SHAPES EVERY FABRICATOR EMITS. One definition, outside the harness.

Every function here exists because the same mistake was made more than once by hand. A shape that
lives in one fabricator is a shape the next fabricator is free to get wrong.

OPCODES ARE HIS: 0 nand, 1 and, 2 or, 3 xor, 4 not. Twelve of his own files agree and X2 confirms
it across all 1,406,857 stored gates (nand 40.06%, and 22.46%, xor 25.94%, or 9.96%, not 1.58%).

Every builder takes `(g, w, ...)` - the gate list and the next free wire - and returns the new `w`.
Gate records are physical `<BQQQ>` op|a|b|out at absolute file addresses; nothing here emits a
circuit-local wire id, because a typed circuit can never take a ring's shared bit.

def hold_cell(g, w, new, write, cell):
    """TAKE-OR-HOLD.   cell' = (new AND write) OR (cell AND NOT write)

    ⛔ THE MISTAKE THIS EXISTS TO STOP, made SEVEN times in one session on 2026-08-07:
       writing `AND(source, condition)` straight into a state address, believing it means
       "write when the condition holds." It means "write when the condition holds AND ERASE
       OTHERWISE." The seven sites and what the erase did:

         1 aperture budget          a bounded config expired on its first quiet settle
         2 envelope staging         the published envelope blanked immediately
         3 witness staging          the captured bytes vanished - kills the two-slot design
         4 aperture shadow          a change during a gated settle was destroyed, unrecorded
         5 drop count               absent entirely, so loss read as quiet
         6 generation counter       a 64-link ripple where a prefix belongs
         7 AUTOFAB0 gene-7 lanes    seven of eight geometries zeroed on every settle

    ⛔ WHY NO TEST FOUND ANY OF IT: every test drives an input that DOES write, so the condition is
       always true and the hold path never runs. A defect on the idle path is invisible to a
       battery that never idles - and in a machine that runs continuously and publishes
       occasionally, THE QUIET SETTLE IS THE COMMON CASE. Building for the exception let the
       normal path destroy state.

    Owner, 2026-08-07: "ITS NEVER INERT." A cell that is not being written is not doing nothing -
    it is HOLDING, and holding is something the wiring has to say.

    ⚠ An UNCONDITIONAL self-clock - `OR(src, src, dst)` - is safe by construction and needs none of
      this. READER1's and mafab_reader's shadows are that shape and are clean. The hazard appears
      the moment a state write becomes conditional.

    `cell` is written to its own address: out addr == in addr, self-clocked, the one deliberate
    SSA exception and the thing that makes state advance with no scheduler.

    sooner and the whole operation stays inside one settle as the width grows.
    Depth falls faster than area rises, so the swap wins - and 81.75% of every gate in the stored
    corpus is already off the critical path, so the area is there.

    ⛔⛔ THE LAW. Owner, 2026-08-08: "1 TICK MAX PER OPERATION NOT FUCKING MORE THAN ONE"

    A TICK IS A SETTLE, NOT A GATE-DELAY. His words and his own tools, all agreeing:
      · "electron drives clock, clocks tick the muhlnickel each tick is a computational step"
      · "A tick is a PULSE, not a bake."
      · his CLINT measurement: "DEPTH 48 gate-delays - one tick = one settle (64-bit increment +
        unsigned 64-bit compare + msip register + irq, ALL IN THAT SETTLE)"
      · pfc_speed.py prints "critical-path DEPTH D : {D} gate-delays", and states that a signal
        "settles a whole DEPTH LEVEL of gates AT ONCE, in parallel, at electron speed"

    So forty-eight gate-delays is ONE TICK. The wavefront sweeps the entire cone in one pulse.

    ⛔ WHAT WAS WRONG HERE, and it is not cosmetic. Every table in this project printed GATE-DELAYS
       under a column headed TICKS - this module's own docstrings, muhl_cable, the build log,
       READER1.layout.json ("ticks": 9), APERTURE0.layout.json ("2 gates / 2 ticks"), FOLD0's
       "depth_ticks": 6, DISCRIM1's "depth_ticks_input_to_answer": 22. Renaming his unit and then
       scoring on it means every "63 ticks vs 11 ticks" figure is a gate-delay ratio wearing his
       word. The RATIOS are real and measured. The UNIT was mine, and it inflated his tick count
       by the depth of the circuit.

    WHAT ACTUALLY COSTS A SECOND TICK: an operation that cannot finish in one wavefront because it
    needs a state cell to take a new value and then be READ AGAIN. Iterative multiply, restoring
    division, shift-and-add loops, anything shaped "repeat until" - those are multi-settle and are
    exactly what the law forbids. Combinational depth is free of this: however deep the cone, it
    settles once. FOLD0 measures depth_in 6 -> depth_out 6 across all six rounds while gates fall
    2,079 -> 819; DISCRIM1 resolves 330 magics at depth 22. One settle in both cases.

    HOW THIS COUNTS: a state address written by a gate, then read by a gate that writes ANOTHER
    state address, is a second wavefront. One pass over the state = 1 tick.
