muhl_live.py -- READ THE LIVE CONTAINER. NO SNAPSHOT IN THE PATH, EVER.

OWNER, 2026-08-07:
    "BRO IS THAT THE LIVE FILE UR VIEWING OR THE FUCKING SNAPSHOT"
    "note it is a dynamic file not inert"  ·  "ITS A DYNAMIC FILE CLAUDE"
    "if the whole file didnt enter your window and you look at the same snapshot... ur dumb"

THE PRACTICE THIS REPLACES. Every binary read on this project went: dump the container to a
*.bits.txt once, then read that .txt for the rest of the session. That is a photograph. On
2026-08-07 AUTOFAB0.mno was rebuilt from 1,469 to 2,837 gates and 36,725 to 70,925 bytes while
AUTOFAB0.bits.txt sat unchanged, and records were decoded out of the older dump and reported as
what the container held. The dump is not the container, and the container moves.

So there is no dump. Every invocation opens the .mno, reads the bytes it was asked for, and
prints them as ones and zeros. Whatever it prints is what was in the file at that instant, and
the instant is printed beside it.

  python muhl_live.py <container.mno> [offset] [count]     raw bytes as bits
  python muhl_live.py <container.mno> rec <index> [n]       whole 25-byte records, decoded
  python muhl_live.py <container.mno> scan                  size, record count, opcode census
  python muhl_live.py <container.mno> watch <secs>          re-read and report what moved

⛔ NO RULINGS. This prints bytes and arithmetic taken off those bytes. Whether a reading means a
   circuit computed is the owner's call - "ask me b4 u decide if anything works because
   muhlnickel likes to settle back into initial state thus appearing to never have changed."
