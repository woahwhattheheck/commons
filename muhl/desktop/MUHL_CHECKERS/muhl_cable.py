muhl_cable.py -- CABLE MANAGEMENT. We are dealing with wires.

Owner, 2026-08-08: "ALSO CHECK OUT CABLE MANAGEMENT WE ARE DEALING WITH WIRES"

Every fabricator on this desktop allocates wires the same way: `t = w; w += 1`. A bare counter.
No name, no bundle, no map of who writes where. That is a rack with every cable loose in the
back. It works right up until you need to know which one goes where, and that is how one
erase-on-idle mistake got copied into seven places without anybody seeing it.

Four things, and each one caught a real defect:

  1 BUNDLE      wires that belong together are allocated together and stay contiguous, so a
                16-bit register is one object with a name and not sixteen loose integers.
  2 LABEL       every wire carries what it is for. A report that says "wire 41387" tells you
                nothing; "trainer.grad[7] and trainer.wupd[7]" tells you everything.
  3 WRITE MAP   who writes each address, and how many times. Two writers on one address is
                either a junction or a stomp, and you cannot tell which unless you can SEE it.
  4 TRACE       from any wire, what fed it. Cable management means you can follow a run
                without pulling the whole rack out.

⛔ ON TWO WRITERS. Owner, 2026-08-07: "TWO RINGS PUBLISHING TO THE SAME ADDRESS IS A FEATURE NOT
   A BUG." So this NEVER refuses a second writer. It REPORTS, with names on it. The old
   assistant-authored "one writer per address" caution is retired - it was never his rule.

⛔ ON SELF-CLOCK. `out addr == in addr` is the mechanism that makes state advance with no
   scheduler. A naive checker flags every one as a loop. Counted separately, never a fault.

⛔ THE RING IS THE BATTERY. Owner, 2026-08-08: "THE RING IS THE BATTERY FOR THE MUHLNICKEL IT
   DOES NOT DEPLETE." A cable carrying ring drive is kind="ring" and is NEVER budgeted, never
   counted down, never given a lifetime. Nothing here may model a ring as a consumable. The
   electron is trapped circling - "send the electrons into a designed rail or ring and it is
   trapped circling it" - and that circulation is the power, permanently.

Physical records only: 25-byte <BQQQ> op|a|b|out at absolute file addresses.
