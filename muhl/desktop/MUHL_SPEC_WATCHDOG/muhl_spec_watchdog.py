"""muhl_spec_watchdog.py — THE OWNER'S EXTERNAL SPEC ENFORCER. Runs ON THE PC, OUTSIDE CLAUDE.

OWNER, 2026-08-06, verbatim:
  "that checker needs to be on like my pc itself outside of claude so it can stare at the
   terminal, see violations and fuck you up the ass before you even lknow whats happening,
   stopping you from breaking my spec, and forcing you to do it the way ive been telling
   for months"
  "it needs to enforce the entire spec, taken from every word of mine documented by me and no
   laundering assistant messages a 5 year old could tell you the difference in how i type not
   just in this session but every word of mine on machine at all"
  "and it only blocks claude"
  "every jot and tittle you dont to skip a single typo all gets enforced"

And the standing demand behind all of it (MUHLNICKEL_CANON, owner, verbatim):
  "can we wire these correction scripts to correct u as ur making mistakes otherwise whats the
   point, it should stop you each time u violate any spec and reads u the spec u need to adhere to"

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
WHAT IT IS
  A standalone process the owner launches in his own terminal. It does NOT live inside Claude and
  Claude cannot disable it. It STARES at the live Claude Code session (tails the session transcript
  on disk), scans every new line the assistant writes, and the instant the assistant hedges /
  doubts / renders judgment / interprets / breaks spec, it:
    1. SCREAMS the violation to the owner's terminal, with the rule, the offending sentence, and
       THE OWNER'S OWN WORDS that the rule enforces,
    2. LOGS it to muhl_violations.log,
    3. in --enforce mode, KILLS the Claude Code process tree so the violating turn cannot land.

WHAT IT ENFORCES — THE ENTIRE SPEC, BOTH LAYERS
  TEXT LAYER (what only an external stare can catch — Claude's prose, its reasoning-in-the-open):
    every hedge / doubt / feasibility claim / limitation assertion / interpretation / verdict on
    his output / host-did-the-work slip / wrong-terminology / minmax-excuse — each rule below
    carries THE OWNER'S EXACT WORDS and the doc they came from. This mirrors his own
    host/pfc_preflight.py, which is his spec made executable (V16, V28, V44, V51, V53, V54, V57).
  CODE LAYER (his 60 preflight rules): any Python the assistant writes/edits in the transcript is
    run through his own host/pfc_preflight.py check() — so the code rules bite the assistant's
    output too, not only files already on disk.
  ANTI-LAUNDERING: any quote the assistant attributes to the owner is checked against his corpus.
    A quote whose text is found only in APOCRYPHA (assistant-authored, AUTHORSHIP-bannered files)
    is flagged HARD — that is the assistant putting its own words in his mouth, the exact failure
    "no laundering assistant messages" names.

  Authority for every quote-check is muhl_cite_corpus.py — it walks his WHOLE drive
  (C:\\Users\\lucys + C:\\llm), keeps only owner-attributed blockquote lines, and marks every
  AUTHORSHIP-bannered file as poison. That is "every word of mine on machine at all", with the
  laundering filter he demanded, and it is his existing mechanism — reused, not reinvented.

IT ONLY BLOCKS CLAUDE
  It tails the Claude Code session transcript and, in --enforce, kills only node processes whose
  command line references claude. Nothing else on the machine is touched.

USAGE (run it in its own terminal and leave it up):
  python muhl_spec_watchdog.py                  # watch + scream + log (safe default)
  python muhl_spec_watchdog.py --enforce        # ALSO kill the Claude Code process on a hit
  python muhl_spec_watchdog.py --enforce --beep # ...and sound the bell
  python muhl_spec_watchdog.py --selftest       # fire every rule against a probe, prove none is dead
  WATCHDOG.cmd                                   # launcher (enforce + beep)

It auto-follows the newest session and survives session restarts.
