"""muhl_prover.py -- FIND proofs, so the checker has something to check.

A checker earns nothing. It only says yes or no to a proof somebody else produced. The money
loop is PROPOSE -> CHECK -> SUBMIT, and until now only the CHECK half existed. This is the
propose half.

WHAT IT DOES
  Forward-chaining search in the same formal system the installed checker verifies (Hilbert
  implicational fragment: axiom K, axiom S, rule modus ponens). Given a goal formula it
  searches for a derivation, and emits it in EXACTLY the format `muhl_proofcheck` consumes --
  so every proof this finds is handed straight to the checker and either survives or does not.
  The prover is never trusted; the checker is the authority.

WHERE IT RUNS -- SUPERSEDED, AND THIS FILE IS NOW THE OUT-OF-SPEC ONE
  This file's search is HOST-SIDE. That was flagged here and then walked past, until the owner
  said so directly on 2026-08-06: "then ur not working in spec then are you?" He was right --
  the checker ran on the muhlnickel while the search ran on the laptop, which is the crutch.

  **`muhl_search_substrate.py` is the in-spec replacement**: modus ponens as a fabricated
  semijoin, where a 222-gate equality predicate decides every membership test bit-sliced over
  storage tables, 62 rows per settle, resident RAM flat. The host addresses windows and reads
  match bits; it compares nothing.

  Keep this file as the enumerating baseline it is -- it is what the index and the semijoin are
  measured against, and it is the thing that saturated at a 20,000-term ceiling. Do not extend
  it as the search path.

WHY FORWARD CHAINING AND NOT SOMETHING CLEVERER
  Because the checker's soundness bar is what matters, and forward chaining produces proofs in
  exactly the shape the checker demands: every line justified by earlier lines only. A cleverer
  search that emitted a proof the checker rejects would have proved nothing.

    python muhl_prover.py                 # prove A -> A and hand it to the checker
    python muhl_prover.py --demo          # a small battery of goals
