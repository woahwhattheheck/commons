# ReuseLedger — NCI Office of Data Sharing Impact Prize 2026 / Track 1

ReuseLedger is a competition-isolated prototype for one concrete data-sharing idea: **make the complete bundle of research outputs surrounding a result machine-checkably reusable, not merely findable one artifact at a time.**

A project declares its datasets, software, protocols, models, publications, and other outputs in a small JSON manifest. `reuseledger.py` validates the graph, normalizes it deterministically, records exact manifest-byte and semantic hashes, derives reuse-readiness findings, and emits a tamper-evident packet plus a human-readable report.

This is deliberately **not another repository**. It is a thin handoff/evidence layer that can sit beside repositories already chosen by investigators and institutions.

## Track-1 fit

NCI's public announcement says the ODS Impact Prize seeks ideas and successful strategies that advance broad, rapid, equitable sharing and reuse of NCI-funded research outputs, explicitly including data, software, tools, methods/protocols, models, clinical-trial results, biospecimens, and other research resources. ReuseLedger targets the gap between "an output exists somewhere" and "a new user can identify the exact related outputs, rights, access conditions, dependencies, and immutable version needed to reuse it."

## Prototype contract

Input schema: `nci-reuseledger-manifest/v1`.

Each output declares a persistent/stable identifier, research-output kind and title, HTTPS landing page, access state, license/rights statement, data-use/access statement when relevant, optional SHA-256 plus byte count, and dependencies on other declared outputs.

The compiler:

1. rejects duplicate JSON keys, duplicate output IDs, unknown dependencies, cycles, non-HTTPS landing pages, malformed fixity, Boolean-as-integer aliases, and unknown schema fields;
2. sorts outputs and dependencies canonically and emits a deterministic graph;
3. flags missing reuse license, access/data-use metadata, and open-artifact fixity;
4. binds both exact source-manifest bytes and normalized manifest semantics;
5. emits a semantic SHA-256 over the complete packet;
6. verifies that a packet is the exact deterministic derivation of the supplied manifest, so a caller cannot edit a score/finding and merely reseal it.

## Local demonstration

```bash
cd competitions/nci-ods-impact-prize-2026
python reuseledger.py compile example_outputs.json --out /tmp/reuse-packet.json
python reuseledger.py verify /tmp/reuse-packet.json --manifest example_outputs.json
python reuseledger.py report /tmp/reuse-packet.json --out /tmp/reuse-report.md
python -m unittest -v test_reuseledger
python -O -m unittest -v test_reuseledger
python readiness_gate.py
```

Expected test state on the checked-in carrier: 15/15 pass under normal Python and 15/15 under `python -O`. The readiness command must return `BLOCKED` until every explicit external-action gate is true.

## Scope and truth boundaries

- No patient rows, PHI, controlled-access datasets, biospecimen records, or clinical decision support are included.
- The tool performs no network access, scraping, repository upload, challenge submission, account mutation, purchase, contact, or prize claim.
- A `100/100` ReuseLedger score means only that this small metadata contract has no rule-based blocker/warning. It does **not** certify scientific validity, legal sufficiency, consent/privacy, clinical fitness, or repository acceptance.
- Any real project still uses its authoritative repository, institution, IRB/privacy, consent, policy, legal, and scientific review processes.

## Files

- `reuseledger.py` — deterministic compiler/verifier/report renderer.
- `test_reuseledger.py` — hostile and end-to-end tests.
- `example_outputs.json` — synthetic demonstration manifest only.
- `SUBMISSION_DRAFT.md` — Track-1 narrative carrier, explicitly not submitted.
- `EVIDENCE_LEDGER.md` — source/truth boundary.
- `READINESS.json` + `readiness_gate.py` — fail-closed external-action gate.

## Current external state

As of 2026-09-13: engineering carrier only. No NCI account registration, eligibility attestation, terms acceptance, external submission, judging result, award, payment, or revenue is claimed.
