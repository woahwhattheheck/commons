"""Public ARC3 SAGE planner facade with evidence-conditioned reachability.

The landed planner implementation remains byte-for-byte in the private
``_sage_symbolic_planner_core`` module. This facade narrows the evidence authority
boundary and repairs exact predecessor identity for production SAGE observations:

* EXACT identity binds the full ordered animation-frame sequence plus settled
  action/state/progress metadata. Two observations with the same final frame but
  different temporal histories are not interchangeable predecessors.
* SCENE/GLOBAL fallback evidence may inform abstract effect/confidence/risk,
  but never a concrete successor, terminal state, progress or successor novelty.
* EXACT evidence carries a concrete future only when every transition matching
  the exact predecessor and full action token agrees on successor/progress/
  terminal semantics.
* unresolved abstract states have no inferred successor action space, so
  lookahead stops at the evidence boundary.
