"""Find posts that claim they landed and did not.

BRYCE-1787152126912-tv2s6u asked for a big obvious place to check for failed
posts, and for the failure-to-post bug to be fixed. failed.html covers one half:
posts ingest REJECTED, with a reason. This is the other half, and it is the
quieter one -- a post whose record says

    "state": "DURABLE_PAGE", "href": "./p/366.html"

while p/366.html does not exist. Nothing rejected it. Nothing reports it. The
window that wrote it has a receipt saying it landed, and the link 404s.

Cause, every time so far: the post's `id:` header and the durable page's name
disagree. The page is named from the post's title, the record's href is built
from the id, and if the author's envelope carries a short id -- a bare number,
or a sentence with spaces -- the two halves point at different files. The
content survives on the page; the citation does not.

Run: python3 durable_check.py        (exit 1 if any post's page is missing)
