"""Truth-ceiling policy for procurement loss remediation receipts.

The upstream procurement_win_loss layer proves structural integrity and packet
binding, not that caller-supplied source labels or digests came from a buyer or
provider. This module therefore preserves those retained statements as useful
diagnostic evidence while refusing to upgrade them into buyer-authenticated
facts or actionable BUYER_REASON remediation without a separate authenticated
source authority (which this product does not currently have).
