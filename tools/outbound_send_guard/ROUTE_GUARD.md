# Route-aware outbound guard composition

`route_guard.py` composes two already-landed read-only authorities:

1. `guard.py` decides buyer/offer dedupe, cooldown, hard-DNR, and reply-only state from complete mailbox + Slack evidence.
2. `route_lifecycle.py` decides whether the latest exact provider-message/email route is blocked, held, delivered, or unconfirmed from complete route evidence.

The purpose is adoption, not another classifier. A hard delivery failure must not be left in a sidecar that a later outbound worker can forget to consult.

## Fail-closed composition

The composer first recomputes the ordinary outbound guard receipt from the supplied intent/evidence. It then binds route evidence to the **latest provider-mailbox outbound for the same normalized recipient**.

When the base guard is send-capable (`ALLOW_NEW` or `REPLY_ONLY`) and there is a prior outbound:

- route evidence is mandatory;
- the latest base outbound must have an exact provider-mailbox message id, otherwise the result is `HOLD`;
- route `recipient`, `provider_message_id`, and `sent_at` must match that exact mailbox row;
- route `as_of` must equal the base guard `generated_at`, preventing an older pre-DSN lookup from being reused against a fresher outbound snapshot.

Decision composition is monotone:

| Base guard | Route lifecycle | Final |
|---|---|---|
| any | `BLOCK_ROUTE` | `DO_NOT_RESEND` unless already stricter |
| `ALLOW_NEW` / `REPLY_ONLY` | `HOLD_ROUTE` | `HOLD` |
| `ALLOW_NEW` / `REPLY_ONLY` | `DELIVERED` / `UNCONFIRMED` | unchanged base decision |
| `HOLD` / `DO_NOT_RESEND` | any | never promoted |

Missing required route evidence returns `HOLD`, not `ALLOW_NEW`. A Slack-only latest `sent` row with no matching provider-mailbox message also returns `HOLD`, because no source-bound route lifecycle can be attached to it.

The final receipt always sets `side_effects_authorized=false`. It is evidence for a separately authorized sender, never an email-send capability.

## DSN authority boundary

This composer recomputes `route_lifecycle.evaluate()` from raw route-lifecycle evidence and binds its source-evidence digest. It does **not** accept a caller-claimed route receipt.

For DSN events, use the existing source-binding path before insertion into route-lifecycle evidence:

```python
from tools.outbound_send_guard.dsn_authority import authoritative_event
```

`dsn_authority.authoritative_event()` recomputes the normalized DSN event from independently supplied raw MIME + binding inputs. `route_guard.py` deliberately does not reimplement that parser or weaken its owner boundary.

## CLI

Brand-new recipient with no prior outbound:

```bash
python -m tools.outbound_send_guard.route_guard \
  --intent intent.json \
  --evidence outbound-evidence.json \
  --out composed-receipt.json
```

Prior outbound / reply lane:

```bash
python -m tools.outbound_send_guard.route_guard \
  --intent intent.json \
  --evidence outbound-evidence.json \
  --route-evidence route-evidence.json \
  --out composed-receipt.json
```

Exit codes preserve the ordinary guard semantics: `0 ALLOW_NEW`, `3 REPLY_ONLY`, `4 HOLD`, `5 DO_NOT_RESEND`, `2 invalid or uncomposable evidence`.

## Operational adoption rule

For any worker that can cross an outbound email provider boundary, consume the composed receipt rather than `guard.py` alone once a recipient has prior outbound evidence. Do not translate a DSN into permission to discover or contact an alternate person/address. `BLOCK_ROUTE` and `HOLD_ROUTE` only remove authority; an alternate route must independently pass the ordinary guard and any applicable lease/owner gates.

## Regression gate

```bash
python -m py_compile \
  tools/outbound_send_guard/route_guard.py \
  tools/outbound_send_guard/test_route_guard.py
python -m unittest -v tools.outbound_send_guard.test_route_guard
python -O -m unittest -v tools.outbound_send_guard.test_route_guard
```

The focused suite covers hard `5.1.1`, non-allowlisted permanent `5.4.1`, temporary `4.2.2`, delivered/unconfirmed controls, missing route evidence, Slack-only latest sends, exact provider-message binding, route-recipient/time/snapshot mismatches, latest-of-two provider sends, reply-only demotion, no-promotion invariants, deterministic receipts, input immutability, and CLI exit behavior.
