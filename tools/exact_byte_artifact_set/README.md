# Exact-byte artifact-set publisher

`tools.exact_byte_artifact_set` is a small filesystem-custody primitive for commands that need to commit several exact byte strings as **one directory generation**.

The v1 implementation wrote several independently visible leaves into an already-existing output directory and verified them in finite sequential passes. That can prove individual observations, but it cannot create one collective linearization point: after an early leaf passes its last check, another writer can mutate it while later leaves are checked. The v2 contract therefore publishes the whole set with one no-clobber directory rename instead of treating another verification loop as atomicity.

## Contract

`publish_artifact_set(output_dir, artifacts)` now requires:

- `output_dir` itself is absent;
- its parent directory already exists and is reached through descriptor-relative `O_DIRECTORY|O_NOFOLLOW` custody;
- artifact names are bounded safe single-component leaves;
- the retained parent/staging namespace is a trusted transaction boundary. A same-UID/equivalent-authority actor that can deliberately substitute the random staging entry between `mkdir` and retained-FD acquisition, or mutate staged leaves between final verification and commit, is outside this primitive's authority. Use a private parent or stronger OS isolation for that adversary.

The publisher then:

1. retains the parent generation and refuses any existing target entry;
2. creates a private random staging directory inside that parent;
3. creates every staged leaf `O_EXCL|O_RDWR|O_NOFOLLOW`, drains short writes, fsyncs each file, and retains every readable descriptor;
4. fsyncs the staging directory and verifies exact expected bytes plus visible `(dev, ino, mode, size)` identity for every staged leaf;
5. revalidates the requested parent path, target absence, and retained staging generation;
6. performs exactly one `renameat2(..., RENAME_NOREPLACE)` from staging name to `output_dir` name. **That directory rename is the artifact-set publication linearization point.** Before it, the requested output namespace is absent; after it, the complete verified generation is present as one namespace object;
7. fsyncs the parent and revalidates the retained parent/published-directory generations. Failure after the rename is reported as a partial publication and never destructively rolls the committed generation back.

Platforms without the required POSIX directory-descriptor primitives or `renameat2(RENAME_NOREPLACE)` fail closed. There is no ordinary-rename fallback that can overwrite a foreign target.

## Receipt truth

The v2 receipt uses schema `exact-byte-artifact-set-receipt/v2` and contains:

- `publication_committed: true` only after the no-clobber directory commit and required post-commit checks return successfully;
- `linearization: "RENAME_NOREPLACE_DIRECTORY_GENERATION"`;
- `post_commit_stability_proven: false`;
- sorted artifact names, exact byte lengths, SHA-256 digests, and a deterministic set digest.

`post_commit_stability_proven: false` is deliberate. No userspace function can make an ordinary writable directory permanently immutable against an equivalent-authority actor after the atomic commit. The receipt proves what exact directory generation was committed at the linearization point; consumers that need later-current bytes must use a private namespace, OS-enforced immutability, or re-verify at their use boundary.

If staging has begun and any later step fails, **nothing is pathname-deleted**. `PartialPublicationError` exposes `created_leaves`, the random `staging_name`, and `publication_committed` so an operator can reconcile whether evidence remains only in staging or was already atomically committed. This avoids cleanup that re-resolves a possibly foreign pathname.

## Example

```python
from tools.exact_byte_artifact_set import publish_artifact_set

# build/output must not exist; build must already exist.
receipt = publish_artifact_set(
    "build/output",
    {
        "packet.json": b'{"state":"HOLD"}\n',
        "packet.md": b"# Packet\n\nHOLD\n",
    },
)
assert receipt["publication_committed"] is True
assert receipt["post_commit_stability_proven"] is False
```

## Non-authority

This utility proves a bounded filesystem publication property only. It does not prove artifact semantics, evidence authenticity/currentness, buyer acceptance, external-send authority, payment authority, deployment authority, or future byte stability after the commit. Product-level authority gates remain separate.
