# EDSS migration/interoperability acceptance evidence

`commercial.edss_migration_acceptance` is a provider-free acceptance harness for disease-surveillance modernization work. It is deliberately **not** an EDSS, an epidemiology engine, a clinical rules system, an HL7/FHIR certification suite, or a security/compliance attestation tool.

Its job is narrower and commercially useful: given synthetic/deidentified or separately approved **opaque IDs and hashes**, prove whether a declared source export, target export, and interface-event set reconcile exactly enough for a human implementation team to review migration/cutover evidence.

The public package never needs patient names, DOBs, addresses, diagnoses, conditions, lab results, clinical notes, or raw HL7/FHIR payloads. Rows contain only stable synthetic/opaque record IDs, field IDs, and value hashes. Interface evidence contains only envelope identifiers, sequence numbers, timestamps, payload hashes, and acknowledgement metadata.

## What it checks

### Migration snapshots

Each source/target snapshot binds:

- stable snapshot ID;
- role (`SOURCE` or `TARGET`);
- schema revision;
- capture time in canonical UTC seconds;
- complete-export declaration;
- exact record count;
- canonical SHA-256 of normalized rows.

A row contains a stable opaque record ID and a nonempty set of `field_id -> value_sha256` entries. The compiler classifies the union of source, target, and independently retained expected IDs as:

- `PARITY_OK`
- `MISSING_TARGET`
- `UNEXPECTED_RECORD`
- `EXPECTED_SOURCE_MISSING`
- `FIELD_MISMATCH`
- `DUPLICATE_SOURCE`
- `CONFLICT_SOURCE`
- `DUPLICATE_TARGET`
- `CONFLICT_TARGET`

Duplicate rows are not silently collapsed. Exact duplicates and conflicting reuse of the same canonical ID are distinct findings.

### Independent expectation observation

The expectation object is a separate evidence boundary. It binds the retained source snapshot ID + source digest, exact expected record-ID set, and exact expected interface-event set with order-invariant digests.

The compiler can verify the observation is internally bound, fresh, and consistent with the supplied source snapshot. It **cannot authenticate the external system that minted the observation**. Production adapters must obtain that authority independently; a caller-written expectation is not transformed into provider truth by this library.

### Interface acceptance

Observed interface events are payload-free envelopes:

- interface ID;
- message ID;
- logical record ID;
- source sequence;
- event time;
- received time;
- payload SHA-256;
- bounded acknowledgement list (`ack_id`, time, `ACKED|REJECTED`).

The compiler detects:

- exact replay duplicates;
- same message ID reused with conflicting event identity/payload;
- unexpected or missing expected events;
- event references to unexpected logical records;
- non-monotone source sequence in receive order;
- missing acknowledgements;
- duplicate acknowledgement IDs;
- multiple acknowledgements where the acceptance contract expects one;
- rejected acknowledgements;
- impossible receive/ack chronology;
- stale/future event evidence;
- events outside the declared cutover interval.

The cutover interval is half-open: `start <= event_at < end`. Exact start is included; exact end is excluded.

This is transport/evidence reconciliation. It does not prove semantic HL7/FHIR conformance or public-health correctness.

## Receipt states

- `ACCEPTANCE_READY` — complete source/target exports, fresh and bound expectation, every record at parity, every expected event observed exactly once with one ACK, no contradictions.
- `EVIDENCE_INCOMPLETE` — a source or target export is explicitly not complete.
- `EVIDENCE_STALE` — otherwise valid evidence exceeds the declared freshness policy.
- `MIGRATION_MISMATCH` — migration row reconciliation has one or more findings.
- `INTERFACE_MISMATCH` — migration is clean but interface acceptance has one or more findings.
- `HOLD` — structural/binding/chronology/future-evidence contradiction that should not be downgraded into a normal mismatch.

A state is not vendor acceptance, State acceptance, production readiness, award, payment, or recognized revenue.

## Determinism and replay

The compiler normalizes rows, field sets, expectations, and observed event ordering before hashing. Receipt JSON is canonical and byte-stable for the same normalized packet, policy, and trusted `as_of`.

`verify` recompiles from the exact receipt `as_of`. That proves the **historical receipt** is untampered; it intentionally does not claim that old evidence is still fresh today. A current operational decision requires a new compile from current approved/provider evidence.

## CLI

The production CLI captures current UTC internally; there is no production backdating flag.

```bash
python -m commercial.edss_migration_acceptance.cli compile \
  --input commercial/edss_migration_acceptance/fixtures/synthetic_ready.json \
  --json-out /tmp/edss-receipt.json \
  --md-out /tmp/edss-receipt.md

python -m commercial.edss_migration_acceptance.cli verify \
  --input commercial/edss_migration_acceptance/fixtures/synthetic_ready.json \
  --receipt /tmp/edss-receipt.json
```

Input files must be bounded regular files. Outputs are create-exclusive ordinary files; existing outputs and final-component symlinks fail closed.

## Public synthetic fixture

`fixtures/synthetic_ready.json` is wholly synthetic. Its apparent source/target rows contain only three opaque records and hashes of invented strings. Its three interface events are invented envelopes. The fixed proof receipt in `fixtures/synthetic_ready_receipt.json` was compiled at the fixture's frozen acceptance time and is suitable for deterministic offline verification, not a current provider assertion.

## Verification

```bash
python -m unittest commercial.edss_migration_acceptance.test_acceptance -v
python -O -m unittest commercial.edss_migration_acceptance.test_acceptance -v
python -m py_compile commercial/edss_migration_acceptance/*.py
```

The hostile suite covers clean parity, missing/unexpected/mismatched/duplicate/conflicting rows, incomplete exports, stale/future evidence, source/expectation binding, event omissions/extras/replay/conflict/order, missing/rejected/duplicate/multiple ACKs, chronology, cutover boundaries, order invariance, duplicate JSON keys, non-finite JSON, bool/int traps, unsafe timestamps/hashes/IDs, raw-payload-shaped unknown fields, receipt/policy/input drift, create-exclusive output, and symlink refusal under normal and optimized Python.

## Authority ceiling

The package performs no network calls and carries no provider credentials. It has no authority to:

- access or mutate a production EDSS;
- receive or persist PHI/PII;
- make clinical, epidemiological, reportability, diagnosis, or case-management decisions;
- certify HL7/FHIR, security, privacy, accessibility, legal, or regulatory compliance;
- contact a buyer/vendor, register a portal, submit a proposal, sign, quote on another party's behalf, spend, deploy, or recognize revenue.
