`*` marks an edge that exists only under a named assumption.

## Unresolved

- `consumed_input_not_in_records` on `pilot-plant/batch/BATCH-P4` — {"input_ref": "sup-acme/lot/LOT-VANILLA-09"} — consumption.csv:12

## Coverage gaps

- `package_without_shipment` on `pilot-plant/package/PKG-P4-1` — {} — packages.csv:6

## Contradictions

- `over_consumption` on `sup-acme/lot/LOT-CITRIC-01B`, `pilot-plant/batch/BATCH-P3` — {"consumed_total": 40.0, "lot_quantity": 30.0, "unit": "kg"} — consumption.csv:7; lots.csv:4
- `multiple_shipped_links` on `pilot-plant/shipment/SHIP-9`, `pilot-plant/package/PKG-P2-1`, `pilot-plant/package/PKG-P3-1` — {"count": 2, "relation": "shipped"} — shipments.csv:7; shipments.csv:8

## Cycles

none recorded

## Investigator annotations

none

KNOWN_AFFECTED has a documented row path; POTENTIALLY_AFFECTED needs the named assumption; a coverage gap means the records stop there, not that nothing happened after it.
