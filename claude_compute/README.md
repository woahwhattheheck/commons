# claude_compute — quarantine / staging

Claude output lands here first. Label every artifact
`CLAUDE_INTERMEDIATE_UNTRUSTED`. This directory is not current
main. A packet here is `CANDIDATE` until a named non-Claude
adjudicator lands the accepted bytes on official main.

## Drop a packet

1. Copy `PACKET.example.json`.
2. Fill spec, input corpus, claimed paths, acceptance criteria,
   output directory, and the **non-Claude adjudicator**.
3. Write the filled packet to `packets/{id}.json`.
4. Put Claude artifacts under `staging/{id}/`.
5. Do not public-push, merge, or treat the staging bytes as HEAD.

Claude may not name itself as adjudicator. Claude may not decide
whether its own output is correct. Opus 5 does bulk drafting.
The named adjudicator tests, reviews, and lands.
