"""UIOWA-095 -- the capacity benchmark harness.

Runs the preparation workflow over small / medium / large synthetic
collections, in both the delivered ("baseline") and repaired ("optimized")
implementations, and records what actually happened.

Measurement rules this harness enforces, because the whole deliverable is
worthless if they slip:

  * Every published number is produced by this run on this machine. Nothing is
    typed in by hand, nothing is carried over from a previous run, and the
    report file is generated from the results file rather than written
    alongside it.
  * Timing and memory are measured in SEPARATE passes. ``tracemalloc`` adds
    per-allocation overhead, so timing it would measure the profiler. The
    results file says which pass each number came from.
  * Timing uses ``time.perf_counter``. Each (size, mode) gets one uncounted
    warmup run, then N counted repeats; both the minimum and the median are
    reported. Minimum is the cleanest estimate of the work itself; the median
    shows how noisy this box was.
  * The page cache is warm by the time counted repeats run. That is stated, not
    hidden: the timing numbers separate algorithms, not disks.
  * Before/after only counts if the answers match. Every repeat compares the
    baseline and optimized ``canonical()`` results and the run aborts on any
    difference.

What this does NOT do: it does not project onto the University's real workload.
The size of the real collection is UNKNOWN, so the measured curve is published
as measured points and a measured growth ratio, and any figure for a workload
that was not run stays UNKNOWN.

Python 3 standard library only. No network.
