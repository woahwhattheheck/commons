# UIOWA-095: generating a collection without replacing operator data

The collection is synthetic; its successful generation is not an assessment finding or a performance measurement. OP5-OBSIDIAN authored the retained benchmark and workloads. OP5-MARROW identified the existing-output deletion. ZZ–HALYARD-86 / GPT-6 Astra Pro implemented and executed this repair.

## Operator contract

`generate_collection.py --out PATH` requires a **new leaf directory**. It refuses an existing nonempty directory, an empty directory, a regular file, a directory symlink, a file symlink, or a dangling symlink. The program never recursively deletes output. Missing parent directories may be created. A relative path is relative to the current working directory; `--out .` is therefore refused.

Run from this component directory with a destination that does not yet exist:

```sh
python generate_collection.py --profile small --seed 20260919 --out /tmp/uiowa095-small-new
```

Exit 0 and the printed JSON summary establish that this invocation completed. An existing destination or an expected input/filesystem error produces exit 2, an explanation on stderr, and no success summary. Use a different new destination after either a successful earlier run or a failed run. Do not delete a directory merely to make a demo command succeed.

`benchmark.py --keep-workdir PATH` still uses a profile-named child directory per size. A repeated run must use a fresh work directory when those children already exist. Historical `results/` files and benchmark methodology remain retained; this repair does not change the benchmark's separate results-file overwrite behavior or recompute historical timings.

## Interrupted and failed generation

The generator first validates the workload and seed, reserves the new destination with exclusive directory creation, and creates an empty `.uiowa095-incomplete` directory. It removes that marker only after writing and summarizing the collection successfully. Failed and interrupted runs retain their output for inspection. The generator will not reuse that directory.

A marker means **incomplete invocation**, even when `manifest.json` exists. A late filesystem failure can occur after the manifest is written. Do not pass such a collection to the benchmark or another consumer. Existing downstream consumers have not been changed to inspect this marker, so they must not infer completion from the mere presence of a manifest. An operator or orchestrator must observe successful completion and absence of the marker before consumption.

This design prevents destructive retry behavior. It is not atomic multi-file publication, a transaction, an fsync/crash-durability guarantee, or protection against a process replacing ancestor directories concurrently. Parent-directory symlinks are not rejected. Keep the destination under a directory controlled by the operator; this is not a hostile multi-user filesystem defense.

## Workload compatibility

Successful default small, medium, and large collections preserve every original byte and every summary field at seed 20260919. The retained reference was generated from original source blob `6a21c5b6df263960c88bbc992d7bbfd78399bd4c`, not from the repaired implementation. The test suite reads the reference without updating it.

Custom workloads require a `Profile`, a nonblank name, positive integer counts for evidence/findings/recommendations/statements/documents and `big_doc_every`, and nonnegative integer body-line counts. Boolean, fractional, textual, or missing counts are rejected before creating output. A seed is an integer, not a boolean; negative integers remain supported. The minimal one-record profile with zero body lines is tested.

## Reproduce the repair checks

```sh
python -m unittest -v test_generation_safety
python -O -m unittest -v test_generation_safety
```

The 27 tests exercise actual filesystem objects and child Python processes, including three competing writers with exactly one winner, ordinary and optimized command-line execution, invalid inputs, retained symlinks, write failure, interruption, late failure, and immutable original-output parity. Only disposable synthetic sentinels are used. `VALIDATION.md` records the actual run and exact source objects.
