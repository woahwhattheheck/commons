"""UIOWA-095 -- the evidence-and-report preparation workflow, under measurement.

This module is the *subject* of the benchmark, not the harness. It runs the
same five stages an analyst runs when turning a collected evidence set into a
report bundle:

    import -> link check -> statement presence -> document label scan
           -> coverage rollup -> export

Two of those stages ship in two implementations, selected by ``mode``:

    mode="baseline"   the algorithm as it appears in the delivered lane tools
    mode="optimized"  the repaired algorithm

Both modes MUST return an identical ``WorkflowResult.canonical()``. That is
asserted in ``test_capacity_benchmark.py`` at every workload size, because a
faster wrong answer is not an improvement.

Where the baseline came from (these are real shipped files, not strawmen):

  B1  revenue/uiowa_rfq_18649_traceability_rehearsal/validate_trace.py
      builds one concatenated report string, then runs
      ``for sid in sids: if sid not in report``. Each test is a full substring
      scan of the whole report. The report grows *with* the statement count,
      so characters scanned grow as O(statements x report_length) -- quadratic
      in the size of the engagement.

  B2  revenue/uiowa_rfq_18649_synthetic_collection/validate_collection.py
      checks for a SYNTHETIC label near the top of each evidence document with
      ``path.read_text(encoding="utf-8")[:500]``. That pulls every byte of
      every document into memory to look at 500 characters of it. Cost and
      peak memory are driven by total collection bytes and by the single
      largest document, neither of which the check actually needs.

Neither of those lanes is edited by this lane. This lane ships the repaired
implementation plus the measurement; the fix is reported, not reached across
lane boundaries and applied.

Python 3 standard library only. No network. No writes outside the output dir
passed to ``export_bundle``.

    Split the report once into its maximal runs of id-legal characters and keep
    the distinct runs in a set. An id that equals one of those runs is
    unambiguously present, so it is resolved by a hash lookup instead of a scan.

    Equivalence to the baseline is exact, by construction, not by assumption:
    a run-equal id is a literal substring of the report, so no false 'present'
    is possible; and any id NOT resolved that way is still put through the
    original ``sid in report_text`` scan, so no false 'absent' is possible
    either. That fallback is what makes the optimized path safe when an id is
    embedded inside a longer token (``S-001`` inside ``S-0012``) -- a case the
    hostile test exercises directly.

    Cost is O(len(report_text)) plus O(absent_count * len(report_text)). On a
    healthy bundle absent_count is ~0 and the stage is linear. On a bundle
    where every statement is missing it degrades to the baseline cost, which is
    the correct behaviour and is stated rather than hidden.

    ``finditer`` plus the length filter, rather than the more obvious
    ``set(_ID_CHARS.findall(report_text))``. The first version of this function
    used findall, and the benchmark caught it handing the time win straight back
    as a memory regression: findall materialises every run in the report as a
    list before the set is built, so peak allocation tracked report size, and
    whole-workflow peak at the large size went ABOVE the baseline. A
    timing-only benchmark would have shipped it.

    Both shapes are still measured on every run -- see "Why the shipped repair
    is not the obvious one" in results/BENCHMARK_REPORT.md, rendered from
    benchmark.measure_statement_variants(). Numbers are deliberately not
    repeated here: a figure pasted into a docstring goes stale the next time
    anyone touches the machine, and the generated table cannot.

    Filtering on the lengths the ids actually have is what keeps the retained
    set small. Those lengths are read off the input rather than hardcoded, and
    the fallback scan below means a filtered-out run can never produce a wrong
    answer -- the filter can only cost time, never correctness.
