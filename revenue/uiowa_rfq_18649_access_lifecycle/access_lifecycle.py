"""Human-access lifecycle evidence review (RFQ 18649, work order 053).

Joiner, mover and leaver access across development and deployment environments:
approvals, entitlement reviews, emergency access, and whether an access change
actually reached the systems it was supposed to reach.

The rule this file exists to enforce
------------------------------------
**A written policy is never proof about a case, and a closed ticket is not a
system state.**

Implemented as evidence stages that cannot substitute for one another:

    written_policy -> ticket_request -> approval_record -> execution_record
                                                      -> system_state_observation

Each stage proves only what it is. A policy proves an intent exists and supports
**no conclusion about any individual case**. A closed ticket proves somebody
closed a ticket. Only a `system_state_observation` dated after the change proves
the change reached that system.

Two further rules follow from the order's wording:

*   **Status is per system, never rolled up.** "Evidence that access changes
    reached the relevant systems" is plural. A single aggregate verdict is
    exactly what hides a deployment pipeline that still carries the account, so
    the reviewer gets one status per system and the case status is the weakest
    of them.

*   **An observation before the change proves nothing about the change.** A
    directory export taken the day before someone left says nothing about
    whether their account was removed. Dates are checked, not assumed.

Everything here is synthetic. No real person, account, system or access record is
described, and no output is a University of Iowa finding.
