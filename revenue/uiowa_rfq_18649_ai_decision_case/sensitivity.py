"""Assumption flow: what actually changes the answer, and by how much.

"Rankings remain revisable when real evidence arrives" is a disclaimer. This
module is the mechanism: change an assumption, re-run the case, and see which
statements in the explanation changed and whether the verdict moved.

The finding this produces on every case here is worth stating plainly, because
it is not obvious and it is the opposite of where most attention goes: THE COST
ASSUMPTIONS CANNOT CHANGE WHETHER ASSISTANCE HELPS. Hourly cost, document
volume and horizon are all strictly positive multipliers on a signed quantity,
so they scale the magnitude and can never flip the sign. What decides the
question is the recorded checking and rework effort. This module does not
assert that -- it re-runs the decision at each assumption's declared bounds and
reports what actually happened, so the classification is measured rather than
argued.
