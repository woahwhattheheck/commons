"""Public hardened facade for the canonical proposal-validity gate.

The reviewed 9dee implementation remains structurally preserved in
``_proposal_validity_core.py``, with one later source-literal authority
hardening at the packet-emission seam. This facade closes the clock and
supersession STOPs without otherwise rewriting that large validated core:

* current public APIs capture their trusted clock generation at import time, so
  rebinding ``gate._utc_now`` cannot select or freeze historical time; and
* supersession source-currentness checks run only after exact-offer relevance
  and post-issuance chronology are established. Unrelated or pre-issue history
  remains syntactically validated but cannot veto current truth.
