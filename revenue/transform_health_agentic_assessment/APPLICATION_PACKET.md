## Cover letter core

Dear Transform Health team,

I am applying to support the design, development, integration, testing, and handover of the agentic feature for Transform Health's Health Data Governance Legislative and Regulatory Assessment Tool.

My strongest fit is the technical problem at the center of the assignment: building model-assisted document workflows that remain evidence-grounded, inspectable, and fail closed rather than allowing a generative model, parser, or OCR system to silently become an authority. I would approach the feature as a document-intelligence and evidence-extraction system: legislation is ingested and normalized; candidate text is retrieved for each fixed assessment element; verbatim source evidence is extracted into a closed schema; native-text citations are independently re-verified against the bound source; OCR-derived text remains a non-authoritative candidate until independently checked against the exact source image/page or visually confirmed by an authorized human; and Step 3 is derived only from verified Step 2 state using versioned deterministic rules. Human reviewers retain interpretive and publication authority throughout.

I propose a provider-neutral backend behind a thin WordPress-facing workflow for registration, upload, status, and results. The design supports English, French, and Spanish inputs **and outputs**, including downloadable Step 2 and Step 3 worksheets and the summary report in the selected supported output language while preserving original-language source quotations. It also includes explicit scanned-document/OCR failure paths, configurable token/API-cost ceilings, retained source provenance, benchmark-driven accuracy testing, and UAT before deployment. The attached technical approach maps these controls to the milestones in the Terms of Reference.

I am proposing a total professional implementation fee of **USD 15,000** for the stated consultancy deliverables, allocated across design, implementation, WordPress-facing integration, benchmark/UAT, deployment, documentation, and handover. Any third-party model, OCR, hosting, storage, translation, or messaging service would be buyer-procured or treated as a separately approved pass-through operating service only if Transform Health agrees the service and a written cost cap/change order in advance. No uncapped or surprise operating cost is included or committed.

The attached work samples demonstrate deterministic evidence verification, lineage/provenance binding, human-authority ceilings, and hostile-case testing for agentic systems. They are technical examples rather than claims of prior Transform Health, health-policy, or WordPress delivery. I would use the orientation milestone to bind the implementation to Transform Health's assessment framework, representative documents, hosting/data-handling constraints, OCR/source-image verification policy, multilingual output requirements, and domain-review process.

Thank you for considering the application. I would be glad to walk through the proposed evidence contract, benchmark plan, multilingual output behavior, and deployment architecture with the Transform Health team.

Sincerely,

## Proposal summary

### Objective

Deliver a low-volume, maintainable agentic document-intelligence feature that helps human reviewers populate Transform Health's Step 2 assessment with traceable source evidence and generates Step 3 through transparent deterministic rules.

The system will **not** be represented as a legal interpreter or autonomous legal-finding engine. OCR output is also not treated as source authority merely because a model copies it exactly.

### Proposed architecture

- thin WordPress-facing registration/upload/status/download experience;
- authenticated backend API and asynchronous job worker;
- file validation, source digests, page-preserving normalization, and explicit OCR path;
- lexical + semantic high-recall retrieval keyed to fixed assessment elements;
- model/provider-neutral structured evidence extraction;
- independent post-model verification that every native-text quote is present in the claimed bound source/page;
- for scanned pages, exact source-image/page binding plus a separate image-grounded check or authorized human visual confirmation before OCR-derived text can become `VERIFIED_EVIDENCE`;
- deterministic, versioned Step 3 reducer consuming only verified Step 2 state;
- English/French/Spanish input and output workflows, with original-language quotations preserved in evidence;
- immutable job/source/model/prompt/rule/OCR-verification metadata sufficient to reproduce and audit each result;
- configurable page, token, API-call, retry, OCR, runtime, and cost ceilings;
- explicit `NOT_IDENTIFIED`, `OCR_DERIVED_CANDIDATE`, `UNPROCESSABLE`, `NEEDS_HUMAN_REVIEW`, and `COST_CAP_REACHED` states rather than forced completion;
- benchmark and UAT evidence before production deployment.

Full design: `TECHNICAL_APPROACH.md`.

### Milestones and fee

| Milestone | Timing | Fee | Output |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| 1. Orientation + technical design | by 30 Oct 2026 | $2,500 | requirements, schemas, data-flow/threat model, hosting recommendation, benchmark plan, OCR/source-image verification contract, multilingual output contract, cost model |
| 2. Agentic extraction system | by 30 Nov 2026 | $4,500 | ingestion, retrieval, evidence extraction, native-text citation verifier, scanned-page verification gate, deterministic Step 3, cost controls |
| 3. WordPress-facing integration | by 18 Dec 2026 | $3,000 | registration/access, upload/status/download, authenticated API integration, English/French/Spanish input/output UX paths |
| 4. Accuracy + UAT | by 31 Jan 2027 | $3,000 | frozen benchmark, language/OCR stratification, precision/recall/citation metrics, source-image/OCR authority tests, UAT remediation |
| 5. Deployment + handover | by 26 Feb 2027 | $2,000 | production deployment, user guidance, runbook, technical documentation, maintenance recommendations |
| **Total professional implementation fee** | | **$15,000** | |

The timing follows the buyer's published milestones. Final sequencing can be adjusted during orientation without changing the evidence/authority boundary.

The $15,000 quote is the total professional implementation fee for the deliverables above. It does **not** authorize additional professional fees. Third-party operating services, if any, are outside that fee only when buyer-procured or separately approved by Transform Health under a written cap/change order before use.

### Accuracy and validation

Before tuning, freeze a representative benchmark with exact input-document digests, source-page/image digests for scanned cases, and reference evidence spans. Measure at minimum:

- relevant-span recall;
- evidence precision;
- citation correctness;
- unsupported-positive / hallucinated-evidence rate;
- false `NOT_IDENTIFIED` rate;
- OCR-derived candidate promotion errors, separately from native-text cases;
- latency and cost by page count and language;
- OCR-vs-native-text performance;
- English/French/Spanish output correctness and artifact completeness.

Performance thresholds should be agreed with Transform Health against representative data rather than invented before access to the buyer's corpus. A provider/model/OCR-engine change should trigger the same relevant benchmark before promotion.

### Data protection and operational controls

The implementation baseline is least privilege, server-side secret custody, encryption in transit/at rest, explicit consent and retention controls, deletion workflows, rate/abuse limits, no document text in routine analytics logs, provider/data-reuse terms aligned with buyer policy, and a bounded audit trail for user/job/admin events.

For scanned documents, any retained source images needed to verify OCR-derived candidates must follow the same agreed retention, access, and deletion policy as the uploaded source corpus.

Final choices depend on Transform Health's hosting, residency, confidentiality, WordPress, and data-retention constraints and will be resolved in the orientation milestone.

## Work samples

Use **2–3** samples in the final application. These are deliberately described by what the code proves, not by invented customer history.

### Sample 1 — Agentic GenAI Evaluation Evidence Gate

Repository path:

https://github.com/woahwhattheheck/commons/tree/main/revenue/agentic_genai_evaluation_gate

Relevant capabilities:

- deterministic evidence-portfolio compilation;
- canonical receipt generation and independent verification;
- exact model/build/rubric/trace/result binding;
- human-review, safety, observability, and tool-call evidence binding;
- freshness and hostile-case testing;
- fail-closed handling of malformed, stale, inconsistent, or transplanted evidence.

How it maps to Transform Health: demonstrates the verification discipline needed to keep model output from silently becoming authoritative state.

Truth boundary: buyer-neutral synthetic system; not a Transform Health, health-policy, WordPress, OCR, or legal-document production deployment.

### Sample 2 — Agentic GxP Lineage Evidence Gate

Repository path:

https://github.com/woahwhattheheck/commons/tree/main/revenue/agentic_gxp_lineage_gate

Relevant capabilities:

- source/model/tool/prompt/artifact lineage binding;
- exact replay collapse and conflicting-payload quarantine;
- four-eyes human-review separation;
- deterministic verification and explicit authority ceilings;
- synthetic hostile cases around provenance and workflow state.

How it maps to Transform Health: demonstrates source-to-output traceability and the separation of technical evidence readiness from human/regulatory authority.

Truth boundary: manufacturing-oriented synthetic evidence sidecar; not proof of health-policy consulting or regulatory certification.

### Sample 3 — Snohomish AI Governance Packet Gate

Repository path:

https://github.com/woahwhattheheck/commons/tree/main/revenue/snoco_ai_governance_packet_gate

Relevant capabilities:

- trusted-vs-untrusted source binding;
- deterministic requirement/evidence state;
- fail-closed handling of unsupported authority claims;
- tamper-resistant receipt verification.

How it maps to Transform Health: demonstrates a concrete control pattern for preventing an untrusted document or model-produced assertion from being promoted to an authoritative decision without the required evidence.

Truth boundary: procurement/governance evidence carrier; not health-policy delivery.

## Qualification statement

The application should make the distinction below explicit rather than overclaiming.

**Demonstrated technical fit:** agentic/LLM evaluation, deterministic verification, source/result lineage, hostile-case testing, fail-closed authority boundaries, structured evidence contracts, and software/API implementation.

**To be bound during delivery:** Transform Health's legislative assessment taxonomy, representative health-policy documents, country/language edge cases, WordPress deployment specifics, hosting/data-retention policy, acceptable OCR/source-image verification method, and domain-review protocol.

**Not claimed unless separately evidenced:** prior health-data-governance consultancy, legal practice, prior Transform Health engagement, production multilingual legal-OCR deployment, or a specific public-health credential.

The Terms of Reference make legislative/regulatory/health-data-governance experience desirable; the technical proposal compensates for that gap by making domain interpretation a controlled human input and keeping automated output strictly evidence-grounded.
