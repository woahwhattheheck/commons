# Hive Copy Desk

A runnable, standard-library Python workspace for a copywriting operator. Collect customer briefs, keep a source-linked brand library, work one request at a time per customer, preserve editable revisions, and export the delivery as files. The interface is included; no build step, external model, email service, or package installation is required.

## Run

From this directory, with Python 3.10 or newer:

```sh
python3 server.py --db copy-desk.sqlite3 --demo
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8765`. The optional `--demo` flag loads six finished sample documents for the existing Commons purchasing-paperwork operator and a second queued request. Restarting with the same database and flag reuses the recorded example operations rather than duplicating them. Without `--demo`, start with an empty workspace. Database files are runtime data and should not be committed.

`--db`, `--host`, and `--port` are configurable. The default host is loopback. All people reaching a running instance share its complete operator view; customer grouping is organization, not tenant isolation. This is not a separately deployed customer portal. The browser requires modern JavaScript and a secure context (localhost or HTTPS) for operation IDs.

## Complete the sample workflow

The seeded request starts in review with `landing-page.md` and five distinct email drafts. Open a document, edit its source, enter a revision note, and save. To demonstrate a revision cycle, enter feedback, choose **Request revision**, edit the copy, and save another version. Every saved draft retains its original files, selected claim IDs, brand/source snapshot, brand version, timestamp, and revision note.

Choose **Export editable ZIP** to receive `current/` files, all `revisions/`, and `request.json` with source snapshots. Choose **Mark delivered & start next** to complete the local request and start the next queued item for that customer, ordered by priority and then arrival. Delivery is a local workflow status: no file is emailed, no page is published, and no customer acceptance is asserted. Cancelling a request releases its production slot but leaves the next start manual.

Create a new customer with its voice and claim library before adding a request. Claims use this structure:

```json
[{"id":"offer","text":"The actual supported product behavior","source":"A document, file reference, or source URL"}]
```

Sources are editorial context, not automatic verification. Drafts explicitly select claim IDs. Updating a brand preserves prior snapshots and requires an updated draft before a current review can be marked delivered. This prevents silently delivering an older source version; it does not assess whether the copy is true or stylistically appropriate.

## Persistence and concurrent edits

SQLite stores clients, requests, immutable draft versions, and write receipts. A partial unique index permits only one active, review, or revision request per customer. Transactions serialize starts and delivery/next-item promotion. Different customers can have work in progress concurrently. Version checks reject stale writes rather than overwriting another edit.

Each JSON mutation includes an `operation_id`. Repeating the exact operation and payload returns its original result without another mutation, including after reconnect or process restart. Reusing the ID with a different payload is rejected. The browser retains an unacknowledged payload in that tab's session storage and offers **Retry pending edit**. Do not change a payload when retrying it. Unsubmitted editor changes are not saved until **Save draft for review**; save them before changing requests or leaving the page.

To copy a workspace, stop its server and copy its SQLite database. Keep that database private to the intended operator environment. No runtime customer data is included in this source package.

## API

`GET /api/state` returns the shared workspace. `GET /api/export/{request_id}` returns its ZIP. JSON POST endpoints are:

- `/api/client/create` and `/api/client/update`: `name`, `voice`, `claims`; update also takes `id` and `version`.
- `/api/request/create`: `client_id`, `title`, `kind`, `brief`, integer `priority` from 0 to 100.
- `/api/draft/save`: request `id`, `version`, `files` mapping filenames to text, `source_ids`, and `note`.
- `/api/request/action`: request `id`, `version`, and `action` (`start`, `priority`, `revise`, `deliver`, or `cancel`). Priority takes `priority`; revise takes `feedback`.

Every mutation also takes a unique `operation_id`. Filenames are simple `.md` or `.txt` names; exports never use client-supplied directories. A draft contains 1–20 nonempty documents. An example API client can use the imported `Desk` class directly for local integration; the HTTP boundary uses the same implementation.

## Finished copy sample and source

`example.json` contains the actual editable sample, not generated placeholders: a landing page plus five emails covering introduction, normalized inputs, discrepancy follow-up, review handoff, and next steps. The product exists at [`revenue/hive/purchasing-paperwork-operator/`](../purchasing-paperwork-operator/). All four sample claim groups reference its [pinned README](https://github.com/woahwhattheheck/commons/blob/87d704a55dfef6964a41034ae08750fc922fe7d8/revenue/hive/purchasing-paperwork-operator/README.md), blob `cad0e29d0e3846fe368edfb8881eea6527170dbe`.

The copy describes normalized CSV intake, exact vendor/line matching, discrepancy drafts, source references and review-ready accounting CSV. It does not claim OCR, automatic email, accounting-system posting, discrepancy approval, purchases, payment execution, measured savings, testimonials, or guaranteed outcomes. Square-bracket claim IDs are editorial references for the operator. The emails are unsent source documents, not a mailing campaign. Product pricing and service terms are left for the actual offer owner.

This is the implementation and first finished sample for Hive demand `bm-hive-20260908-030`. An actual customer commission, customer acceptance, subscription sale, and external delivery remain separate. The demand's proposed subscription is not an observed sale.

## Validation

```sh
python3 -W error::ResourceWarning -m unittest -v test_desk.py
python3 -m py_compile server.py test_desk.py
```

The initial delivery passed 27 tests with real temporary SQLite files, concurrent threads, process-style database reopen, ZIP readback, and a real HTTP server/client. They cover one-active-request enforcement, next-item ordering, immutable revisions, changed-brand handling, stale edits, retry safety, malformed data, example loading, and transport errors. Browser JavaScript also passed `node --check` when extracted from the inline script.

The attempted system-Chromium workflow could not navigate to the local server: the browser returned `net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_ADMINISTRATOR`. Therefore actual browser interaction and desktop/mobile visual layout are not claimed tested. HTTP responses and persistence were tested separately. No full Commons battery, hosted CI result, production deployment, customer delivery, or email send is claimed by these local results.
