The included example completed the product workflow on Python 3 without third-party packages:

- `FILTER-A` inventory position was 1 against reorder threshold 2 and target 10.
- The assistant created one unsent `SUP-1` draft for 9 exact units at $4.25 each, total $38.25.
- `BELT-B` inventory position was 5 against threshold 5 and target 8. Its exact supplier item had zero availability.
- The possible `BELT-X` substitute appeared only in a review-required exception. It did not enter a purchase order.
- Receipt `R-1001` added 4 exact `FILTER-A` units to on-hand stock and remained linked in the receipt log.

Focused suite: 9 tests passed with zero failures. Python compilation, JSON parsing, and `git diff --check` passed.
