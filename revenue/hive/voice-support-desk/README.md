# Voice Support Desk

Runnable inbound order-support service for Hive demand `bm-hive-20260908-006`.
It answers from the shop's imported order data and saved policy, takes one
explicitly confirmed return request per order, and supplies a phone-service
handoff to an existing team number. It includes an operator desk, durable call
turns, review queues, CSV onboarding, data export and a source-only ZIP packager.

This is a rule-based speech/keypad workflow, not an unrestricted language model.
Speech recognition, spoken playback and telephone transport are performed by the
shop's existing voice service. The application creates no phone account, makes
no outbound API call, charges no payment and contains no provider credentials.
A local walkthrough is not a real phone call. Provider connection and an actual
staff-answer test are separate steps; they have not been performed for this build.

## Run

Python 3.10 or newer; no third-party packages or installation step.

```sh
cd revenue/hive/voice-support-desk
python3 desk.py --db /your/cloud/workspace/voice-support.sqlite3 import orders.example.csv
python3 desk.py --db /your/cloud/workspace/voice-support.sqlite3 serve
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8096`. The supplied orders are fictional, dated fixtures,
not merchant data. They intentionally age out of the return window. Import a
current shop export for actual use. The service binds to loopback by default.
Do not publish the operator desk or customer database as a public static site.
An existing merchant service connection should forward voice webhooks to this
process; the operator API is local workspace control, not a public customer API.
This build adds no login, signup or account requirement.

Save the shop's actual policy in the desk before automatic return intake.
Until that first explicit save, return requests route to the team rather than
assuming that the displayed 30-day editing default is the merchant's policy.
The return-window date uses the server's local calendar date; configure the
server timezone to the shop's operating timezone. Policy changes are revisioned.
Leave the team phone blank for a clearly announced queue-only fallback, or supply
the shop's existing international-format staff number for a telephone transfer.
Do not enter a test number into a connected production telephone service.

## Complete the local workflow

Start a local call walk-through. Enter fictional order `1001`; request `status`
(or keypad `1`), then `return` (keypad `2`). Give a reason, then explicitly
confirm `yes` (keypad `1`). Exactly one request appears in the team review queue.
A retry of the same call turn returns the identical stored response. A second
call about the same order refers to the same return, including after closure.

Order `1003` is outside the example return window; `1004` is marked non-returnable;
`1002` has not been delivered. These reach the staff workflow rather than an
automatic return decision. Say `agent` or press `0` at any step for the team.
Unsupported requests and two consecutive empty inputs also reach that workflow.
The engine accepts literal references or individually spoken digits, not fuzzy
matches. References that cannot be understood route to the team.

Return creation means **request for review**, not an approved return, shipping
label, restock or refund. Those actions remain in the shop's current system.
A team operator records the review and closes the request here. For handoffs,
provider `completed` means a dial leg ended, not proof that a human handled the
case; the queue stays open until the operator records resolution.

## Current order data

UTF-8 CSV, optional BOM, exact header and five fields:

```csv
order_ref,status,eta,delivered_on,returnable
1001,delivered,Delivered,2026-09-01,true
1002,shipped,Carrier update pending,,false
```

Status is `processing`, `shipped`, `delivered` or `cancelled`. A delivered order
requires a real `YYYY-MM-DD` date not in the future; other states leave that
field blank. `returnable` must be `true` or `false`. References contain letters,
digits and hyphens and are normalized to uppercase. Avoid customer names,
addresses, payment information and other unnecessary private fields.

Imports validate every row before an atomic upsert. Missing rows are retained;
this is not a snapshot-deletion importer. Duplicate references inside one file
and malformed rows reject the entire import without partially changing orders.
Refreshing a reference preserves its call/return history. Both order eligibility
and the current policy are rechecked when the caller confirms a return.

## Existing phone-service connection

The adapter implements Twilio's documented TwiML form contract. Configure the
shop's existing trusted voice relay to forward the following requests and return
the XML responses to the caller. No account configuration is performed by this
package. Keep the desk's operator routes in the merchant's existing workspace;
only the three voice paths below need to be forwarded by that connection.

| Request | Input | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST /voice` | Form `CallSid`, no speech/digits | Initial `Gather` prompt, turn 0 |
| `POST /voice?turn=N` | Same `CallSid`, `SpeechResult` or `Digits` | Durable sequential turn and next `Gather`, `Dial` or `Hangup` |
| `POST /dial-result` | `CallSid`, terminal `DialCallStatus` | Saved outcome and closing/failure message; never redials |

Responses use XML-escaped `Say` text, `Gather input="dtmf speech"`,
`actionOnEmptyResult="true"`, and explicit next-turn action URLs. The adapter
expects form-urlencoded requests, matching Twilio's current reference:
<https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/twiml/gather>.
A configured staff handoff returns `Dial/Number` with a terminal action callback:
<https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/twiml/dial>.
These are protocol references, not evidence of live-provider acceptance.
The reference adapter uses root-relative paths; a relay mounted under a prefix
must preserve or map these paths consistently.

A given `(CallSid, turn)` is immutable. Identical input replays the exact stored
JSON/XML after process restart; different input on the same turn or an out-of-order
turn returns HTTP 409 without changing state. SQLite `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` serializes
return creation and call progression. Independent concurrent calls about one
order still share its unique return request. Phone-service delivery failures do
not repeat a refund, return creation or terminal transfer response.

Provider dial results supported here are `completed`, `busy`, `no-answer`,
`failed` and `canceled`. Failed/missing destinations produce honest queue messages.
The app does not collect audio recordings or claim it can reach an unconfigured
staff member. The queue includes the provider call reference for the shop's team;
no callback is promised or automatically sent.

## Operator API and CLI

`GET /api/state` reads policy, orders, calls, returns and handoffs.
`POST /api/policy` saves exactly `shop_name`, `shipping_text`, integer
`return_days`, and `staff_phone`. `POST /api/import` accepts raw CSV text.
`POST /api/turn` accepts JSON `call_id`, integer `turn`, optional `speech` and
`digits` for the local walkthrough. `POST /api/review` accepts `kind` (`returns`
or `handoffs`), request `id`, `status`, and an operator `note`.
`GET /api/export` downloads the desk data as versioned JSON; handle it as private
merchant data. Call inputs can contain personal information supplied by callers,
so use the shop's existing retention and handling process for the SQLite file.

```sh
python3 desk.py --db desk.sqlite3 policy shop-policy.json
python3 desk.py --db desk.sqlite3 export private-desk-export.json
python3 desk.py bundle voice-support-desk.zip
python3 -m unittest -v test_desk.py
```

Exports and source bundles refuse to overwrite an existing destination.
The source ZIP contains exactly the five named runtime/documentation/test/example
files, not the active database, logs or ambient workspace files. Extract it to a
new cloud directory and run `desk.py` there; the package needs no Commons checkout.
SQLite state is kept outside the source bundle. Preserve the database and export
before moving or removing an installation.

## Delivery boundary and proposed offer

This first version delivers the usable desk and the phone webhook adapter.
The original proposed offer was $299 setup plus $149/month with transparent call
usage, not a charged payment or a commitment from a customer. The customer step
is to connect a real shop export and policy, install the adapter behind the
shop's existing voice connection, then exercise a real order-status call,
confirmed return and staff-answer/failure case. Actual speech accuracy, provider
acceptance, telephone charges and staffing have not been measured in this build.

## Validation on September 8, 2026

In the provided cloud container, `python -B -m unittest -v test_desk.py` passed
32 tests with zero skips (final run: 8.845 seconds). The suite exercises real
file-backed SQLite, reopen/replay, concurrent confirmations, current-policy
changes, actual loopback HTTP form and JSON requests, transfer callbacks,
subprocess CLI export, and an extracted source package. Python compilation and
Node syntax checking of the embedded operator JavaScript also passed.

An installed Chromium was launched for the operator workflow, but native
loopback navigation returned `ERR_BLOCKED_BY_ADMINISTRATOR` before the page
loaded. Browser interaction, layout and download completion remain unverified;
no browser policy or transport workaround was applied. HTTP retrieval of the
actual operator page and API workflow is covered separately by the passing
tests. Fixtures are synthetic. No live call, shop integration, provider change,
customer deployment, payment or infrastructure spend occurred.
