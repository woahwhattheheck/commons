"""UIOWA-114 -- follow-up interview question cards.

What this is
------------
A generator that turns ONE unresolved observation into the ONE question that
would resolve it, with the context a practitioner needs, a concrete artifact to
ask for, and the decision the answer would change.

Why it is a generator and not a question list
---------------------------------------------
The completion condition is "a reviewer can move from a specific unresolved
observation to an appropriate follow-up *without repeating the entire interview
guide*". A written list of good questions IS the interview guide -- the reviewer
already has one. What they do not have is the path from this particular
uncertainty to the question that closes it. So each observation declares the
SHAPE of its uncertainty, and each shape fills a different question template
from the observation's own fields. Templates live in ``data/templates.json``;
no question text is hard-coded here.

The rule that does the real work
--------------------------------
Every card carries an ``outcome_map``: for each plausible answer, what the draft
finding becomes. **A question whose answers all lead to the same finding is
rejected as USELESS_QUESTION and does not render.** If the answer cannot move
the finding, asking it spends a practitioner's hour for nothing, and no amount
of good phrasing fixes that. It is the mechanical form of "don't re-ask the
guide".

Four more, enforced rather than asserted:
  * a card must name a concrete artifact to request -- "any relevant
    documentation" is VAGUE_EXAMPLE_REQUEST and fails;
  * a question may not presume the gap -- a deliberately NARROW lint rejects
    leading phrasing, narrow because a guard that flags correct prose gets
    switched off and then guards nothing;
  * every ABSENT_EVIDENCE card must carry the caveat that absence in the
    supplied material is not evidence the practice does not happen;
  * no observation may be silently dropped -- every one becomes a card, or
    appears in the coverage list with a stated reason, or appears as an error.

Not in scope, on purpose: ranking. UIOWA-113 owns request prioritization, and
two different rank orders in front of one reviewer is worse than none. Cards are
grouped by interview session so a reviewer runs one sitting.

Python 3 standard library only. No network. No model is called.
