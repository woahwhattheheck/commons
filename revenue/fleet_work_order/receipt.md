# Fleet work order synthetic receipt

Status: `WORKING_SYNTHETIC_DEMO`

Fixture `inspection-1042` proves the public engine's binary contract:

- ordinary processing creates one deterministic work-order id and one deterministic escalation id;
- replay returns `REPLAY_NOOP` and preserves the same receipt;
- crashes after prepare and after effect persistence resume to exactly one of each effect;
- incomplete work can remove provisional effects and records `ROLLED_BACK`;
- same id with different normalized bytes returns `CONFLICT`;
- invalid input creates zero effects.

Test command: `node test_fleet_work_order.js`

Expected result: `fleet-work-order: 7 scenarios PASS`.

Limits: synthetic/browser-local proof only. It does not establish a production fleet connector, dispatch, buyer delivery, payment, settlement, payout, or cash. Entry offer is $199 for one business day; $2,500 proof follows only after a buyer-approved fit.
