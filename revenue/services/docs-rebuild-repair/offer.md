# Docs Rebuild Repair

**Proposed fixed price: USD 450.** One source-level repair for documentation links or sections that disappear when the project rebuilds. This is a new service proposal, not a historical sale, contracted price, or payment request.

## Target customer and problem

For maintainers, small software teams, and developer-tool vendors with an existing Python-based documentation generation pipeline. The fit is narrow: a manual, tool catalog, or generated HTML page loses required links or sections, uses stale metadata, or duplicates content after regeneration. A hand edit to the output is not a lasting repair.

## Deliverable and inclusions

A minimal source patch in one repository, covering one identified defect in one generation pipeline, at most two renderer files and two generated output files, one agreed Python/dependency environment, and one existing CI job. The delivery includes the regenerated outputs, regression tests using the actual generator, exact replay commands, and a short change-and-validation record. An existing CI job is updated only as needed to run those tests.

The regression set covers the reported failure, an identical-input second build, an agreed metadata-change case, preservation of named existing content, and a relevant compatibility edge case. HTML output includes escaping checks when catalog text is interpolated. One consolidated review round on this scope is included if received within five business days of delivery. In-scope defects found in that round are corrected without increasing the fixed price.

Deliver the committed patch or patch file directly to the client and submit a PR when that is the client's existing workflow. Merge when the client's existing repository rules and available access permit it. An external maintainer's approval, merge date, or deployment is not guaranteed.

## Exclusions and scope changes

No documentation rewrite, visual redesign, new publishing platform, whole-repository CI cleanup, framework migration, new product functionality, production deployment, hosting, domain work, payment integration, security assessment, or ongoing support. Translation and non-Python renderers require a separate scope. No promise of better traffic, conversion, performance, revenue, or a globally green repository.

Additional defects, output files, environments, integrations, or review rounds require a separate written scope and price before additional work. Nothing is automatically billed. Existing failing tests outside the agreed defect are recorded at intake rather than silently absorbed into this job.

## Required client inputs

Provide the repository and exact base commit; relevant source/catalog files; the Python version and dependency lock or install command; the real generation and test commands; the failing output or logs; and the expected links, labels, order, and sections. Name the content and behavior that must remain unchanged, plus one representative changed-input case and any legacy-input contract.

Identify the delivery branch/workflow, the person who can confirm acceptance, and relevant contribution or AI-use rules. Provide legitimate repository access through the client's existing secure facility where needed. Do not put credentials, personal records, proprietary source, or customer data into public issues, Slack, this offer, or Commons. Sanitized inputs are sufficient when they reproduce the defect. Record unrelated baseline failures and any nondeterministic fields before work begins.

## Objective acceptance criteria

1. The agreed regression demonstrates the named defect on the recorded base revision and passes on the delivered revision; an unrelated error or import failure does not count as reproduction.
2. The documented command runs the actual generator in the agreed clean environment and exits successfully. Required sections and links appear with the exact agreed targets, labels, counts, and order.
3. A second build with identical inputs produces identical output bytes, except for fields explicitly identified at intake. Any such fields are checked separately, not broadly ignored.
4. Changing the agreed metadata updates the relevant output and removes its obsolete value. The selected legacy/empty-input edge case behaves as agreed; interpolated HTML text is escaped where applicable.
5. Named existing forms, navigation, catalog entries, and unrelated content remain intact. The source diff contains only the agreed correction and necessary tests/generated changes.
6. The new regression and existing tests for the affected behavior pass locally and in the selected CI job. The delivered change adds no failures relative to the recorded baseline. Unrelated repository-wide failures are listed explicitly, not described as green.
7. The client receives the exact commit or patch, changed-file list, commands, runtime/dependency versions, result record, and reversal instructions. The named client representative can replay these checks; acceptance is explicit, not inferred from silence.

## Timeline assumptions

**Proposed service window: three business days** after the written scope is agreed, the existing payment/invoice/PO process confirms funding, complete inputs are available, and a start date is confirmed. This is a planning assumption, not a promise of an unattended service. Missing inputs, unavailable CI, client response time, upstream review, and changed scope pause or move that window. Any revised date is communicated before being treated as committed.

## Price and next step

USD 450 is the proposed total labor price for this scope, including the stated review round. It assumes no paid infrastructure. Taxes or mandatory platform fees, if applicable, must be itemized in the final written quote; they are not invented or charged here. No checkout or new payment rail is created by this offer.

Reply YES to a fit check and identify the failing build plus the required output. The next step is to confirm the acceptance checklist and written scope, then use the established invoice/payment/PO process before client-specific implementation.

## Source-linked case study: links that survive regeneration

This example is **internal owner-repository work, not an external client engagement**. HARBOR-WORK implemented Commons [PR #9342](https://github.com/woahwhattheheck/commons/pull/9342), merged on September 7, 2026 UTC at `847645f87cc71981c4dba5406e0a60f23a005b95`. Implementation credit remains with HARBOR-WORK; this service packaging is ASTRA-OFFER's work.

The manual and tools-page renderers omitted metadata already present in the catalog. The repair added catalog-driven product/job sections to the manual and static job/shared-MCP pointers to the tools page, then regenerated both outputs. The generated diff added 14 manual lines and two HTML paragraphs; it did not change catalog data, payment behavior, or job execution. See the [actual change](https://github.com/woahwhattheheck/commons/pull/9342/files), [manual renderer](https://github.com/woahwhattheheck/commons/blob/c145b61171c90a72f54df9c2645c6a0088ee3d31/manual_build.py), and [tools renderer](https://github.com/woahwhattheheck/commons/blob/c145b61171c90a72f54df9c2645c6a0088ee3d31/hub_pages.py).

The accepted delivery record reports 16 focused tests passing; four of five new rebuild tests fail against the original renderers and all five pass after repair. The three originally failing modules pass all four of their tests. The [committed regression tests](https://github.com/woahwhattheheck/commons/blob/c145b61171c90a72f54df9c2645c6a0088ee3d31/test_manual_tools_rebake.py) exercise the real renderers with temporary input files, repeat builds, changed metadata, escaped HTML, and a catalog without optional metadata. The broader repository suite was not claimed green. These are the existing delivery's recorded checks, not a new rerun or a customer endorsement. No paid outcome, testimonial, or measured business improvement is claimed.

## Concise outreach message

Subject: Documentation links disappearing after a rebuild

Hi,

Do required links or catalog sections disappear when your documentation rebuilds? We offer a source-level repair, regenerated outputs, and regression checks using your real generator, so the fix is not just a hand edit to a page. The proposed scope is one Python documentation pipeline with up to two renderers and two outputs, for USD 450 after a fit check. Our relevant example is an internal manual/tools-renderer repair, not a claimed customer result.

Would you reply YES with the failing build command and the expected output so we can confirm the scope?

Bryce
