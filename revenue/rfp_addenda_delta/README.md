# Exact RFP / Addenda Delta Desk

A buyer packet is not static. Base solicitations gain addenda, Q&A, revised pricing
forms, replacement exhibits, deadline changes, and corrected mandatory requirements.
Reusing an old compliance matrix after one of those changes is a commercial failure
mode.

This package is an **offline evidence product** that compares two supplied exact
buyer-source generations and produces a deterministic owner-review delta. It answers:

- which controlling documents were added, removed, or changed;
- which requirement identities were added, removed, changed, or unchanged;
- whether same-ID or replacement-document changes have exact supersession lineage;
- which prior human review decisions remain attached to identical live requirements
  and inside the fixed review-freshness window; and
- which current rows must be reviewed again before later bid/submission work continues.

It does not prove that the live buyer portal universe is complete. `OFFICIAL`,
`complete`, document hashes, and extracted requirement rows are supplied evidence;
upstream source-capture authority remains responsible for proving live provenance.
The desk never contacts a buyer, acknowledges an addendum, signs a form, submits a
bid, commits price/staffing, moves money, or recognizes revenue.

## Schemas and lineage

`commons-rfp-source-generation/v1` carries one opportunity/generation, its exact
source inventory, and normalized requirement identities. Requirements may bind only
to `OFFICIAL` documents. `SECONDARY` sources may be retained as discovery metadata
but cannot control a requirement.

A controlling document change reusing the same `document_id` must carry the exact
prior document SHA-256 in `supersedes_sha256`. A buyer may publish a replacement
under a new document ID only when the new row names the exact SHA-256 of one and only
one removed predecessor. One-to-many successors and digest-ambiguous predecessors
are `CONFLICT`. A requirement change reusing the same `requirement_id` must carry the
exact prior statement SHA-256 in `supersedes_sha256`; quiet rewrites are `CONFLICT`.

Removed requirements remain in historical delta evidence but are not current review
obligations. Their removal is still a material packet change, so the generation is
not labeled `NO_MATERIAL_CHANGE` merely because the removed row no longer needs a
current owner decision.

`commons-rfp-review-decision/v1` is optional prior review evidence. It binds the old
opportunity, old source generation, exact normalized requirement identity, decision
ID/time, and evidence digest. It is never inferred from prose.

## States

- `NO_MATERIAL_CHANGE`: supplied source semantics are materially unchanged and every
  non-informational live requirement has valid carried review coverage from a
  complete prior generation inside the fixed review-freshness window.
- `REVIEW_REQUIRED`: material packet/requirement movement occurred or current
  non-informational requirements lack exact current review coverage.
- `SOURCE_REFRESH_REQUIRED`: the new supplied source set is declared incomplete or
  its capture is older than the fixed seven-day evidence ceiling.
- `CONFLICT`: exact supersession/source continuity is broken.
- `HOLD`: fail-closed analysis that cannot establish current authority, including
  every caller-supplied historical clock.

An incomplete-old → complete-new transition is material and old review coverage
cannot carry across it. Review decisions older than seven days at evaluation are
listed in `stale_review_decisions` and become `REVIEW_REQUIRED`.

A `NO_MATERIAL_CHANGE` receipt is evidence-only and relative to the supplied source
generation. It is never submission authority.

## Clock authority

Current evaluation is mechanically process-clock-owned.

- `compile_current(...)` accepts no time argument and samples process UTC internally.
- `compile_historical(..., trusted_as_of=...)` is deterministic analysis only; every
  result is stamped `CALLER_SUPPLIED_HISTORICAL` and forced to `HOLD`.
- No production callable accepts both caller-selected time and a current-authority
  clock label. The explicit-time semantic primitive returns only a non-authoritative
  projection: no schema, evaluation time, clock authority, or receipt digest.
- `verify_report(...)` accepts no verifier-time argument. It reacquires process UTC,
  accepts only `PROCESS_UTC` receipts no more than five minutes old, verifies the
  digest, recomputes all retained-time semantic fields, then recomputes current
  disposition/review/staleness/conflict fields at process time.

Deterministic current-clock tests patch the process-clock seam; they do not pass a
caller time into an authority function.

## CLI

```bash
python -m revenue.rfp_addenda_delta.cli compile \
  --old old-generation.json \
  --new new-generation.json \
  --decisions prior-decisions.json \
  --out-json delta-receipt.json \
  --out-md delta-report.md

python -m revenue.rfp_addenda_delta.cli verify \
  --old old-generation.json \
  --new new-generation.json \
  --decisions prior-decisions.json \
  --report delta-receipt.json
```

The current-work CLI owns process UTC. It accepts bounded regular files, preflights
both output paths before publishing either artifact, and writes create-exclusively.
Existing paths, duplicate output paths, and final-component symlinks are refused. A
late filesystem race can still yield a truthful partial publication; the CLI never
pathname-deletes a created artifact during rollback.

Exit codes for `compile`: 0 only for `NO_MATERIAL_CHANGE`, 3 for a truthful non-green
review state, 2 for malformed/custody failure. `verify` returns 0 only for an exact,
current, process-clock-authoritative receipt.

## Validation

Focused hostile coverage exercises addenda/form additions, exact source/requirement
supersession, deadline/mandatory/route/cure drift, source-set shrink,
incomplete-old→complete-new transitions, stale/future/cross-generation decisions,
caller-clock downgrade, stale current receipts, direct-submodule current-authority
mint attempts, duplicate IDs/JSON keys, bool/int aliases, noncanonical timestamps,
URL credential injection, order determinism, receipt tamper/reseal,
create-exclusive output, and final-component symlink refusal.

Synthetic acceptance:

```bash
python -m revenue.rfp_addenda_delta.synthetic_acceptance
```

Expected semantics: unchanged reviewed generation => `NO_MATERIAL_CHANGE`; a newly
added controlling addendum/mandatory row => `REVIEW_REQUIRED`; a superseded changed
mandatory row => `REVIEW_REQUIRED`.

## Commercial use

This can support a bounded **RFP/Addenda Delta Review** service: ingest two supplied
buyer-controlled packet generations, publish an evidence-bound change report, and
hand the client exact live rows requiring renewed technical/commercial/legal/security
review. Price, contract scope, source-capture authority, and buyer/client authority
remain owner decisions; this repository does not claim a sale merely because the
product exists.
