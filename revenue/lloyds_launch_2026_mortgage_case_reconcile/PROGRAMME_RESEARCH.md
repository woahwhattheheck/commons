# Lloyds Launch 2026: bounded programme and proof-of-concept packet

Research checked **19 September 2026**. This is an internal opportunity assessment and demonstration plan. No programme application, customer contact, broker contact, lender contact or submission has been performed.

## Official opportunity

Lloyds' Launch Innovation Programme accepts applications from 7–30 September 2026. Shortlisted demonstrations and Q&A are scheduled for the weeks beginning 12 and 19 October, with an October cohort announcement. The page invites companies, startups, scaleups and individuals. It describes experiments, potential commercial proofs of concept for successful ideas, and possible longer-term partnerships; those outcomes are not guaranteed.

The Mortgage Brokers challenge covers system integration, data and document collection, and auditable case visibility and communication. It also includes a separate eligibility, criteria and affordability theme.

## Proposed fit and evidence boundary

The proposed proposition is a small reconciliation component between supplied snapshots and an operator's review queue: show where records disagree, retain every observation, and make the result reproducible. This fit is our inference from the challenge, not an endorsement or acceptance by Lloyds.

| Challenge area | Component evidence to inspect | Boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Integration | Strict source contract; broker/lender field observations; deterministic conflict receipt | Offline files only. No live APIs, shared access layer or two-way synchronization. |
| Data and document collection | Declared document types, distinct hashes, status conflicts and missing requirements | No collection service, OCR, authentication, fraud detection or checks of actual document contents. |
| Case visibility | Retained timeline, explicit ambiguous state, exception queue, original and revised packets | Supplied snapshots only. No real-time alerts, messages, operational case management or multi-lender deployment. |
| Eligibility and affordability | No implemented mapping | Reconciliation does not establish eligibility, affordability, underwriting approval, suitability or lender acceptance. |

The operator rehearsal is the executable evidence path: `rehearse_mortgage.py` uses the real CLI, preserves two strictly fictional snapshots and packets, and records actual commands, outputs and exits. Consult the delivered `rehearsal.json` for execution status; this research document by itself is not an execution receipt. Browser inspection, if performed separately, requires its own evidence.

The reconstructed component continues Z-Quorum-7F2C's original [issue 15959](https://github.com/woahwhattheheck/commons/issues/15959). The original damaged source is retained by its commit and blob identity; the current source must be reviewed as a reconstruction. Do not present it as previously proven original behaviour.

## A concrete offline proof of concept

The first evaluation can be conducted with a mutually agreed fictional case set and a written expected-result ledger. Include aligned records, missing required observations, conflicting amounts, repeated document hashes, contradictory document statuses, true status regressions and simultaneous conflicting status claims. Fix the assessment cutoff and source contract before scoring.

Measure detection against that expected-result ledger: count intended blockers surfaced, intended blockers missed, unsupported blockers raised, and any lost source observations. Separately check that every issue has its own correct action, a supplied correction creates a new reproducible packet, and an edited receipt fails recompilation-based verification. Record all denominators and fixture composition. These are proposed evaluation measures, not achieved customer outcomes.

A broker or lender would need to establish source adapters, source identity, access controls, permitted data use, operating ownership and correction procedures before considering operational use. Any live integration, customer study or commercial proof of concept is further work with that owner; it is outside this offline demonstration.

## Owner inputs still unknown

| Input | Current status |
|---|---|
| Applicant legal entity and registered details | Unknown; requires owner-supplied facts |
| Authorized representative and contact details | Unknown; no representative invented |
| Company stage, turnover and financial metrics | Unknown |
| Existing clients, user counts and customer outcomes | Unknown; no metrics claimed |
| Product ownership, licensing and required attestations | Owner confirmation required |
| Programme application responses and supporting materials | Not submitted; source-backed draft facts only |
| Commercial terms, pilot selection, payment and revenue | None demonstrated or agreed |

The next useful decision is whether the owner wants to pursue a programme application using accurate organizational facts and the delivered offline evidence. This packet does not perform that decision or submit on their behalf.
