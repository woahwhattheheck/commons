# UIOWA-049 — capacity, uncertainty and lifecycle-risk decision readout

**SYNTHETIC demonstration — not University findings, measured savings, an approved investment or a staffing commitment.**

Prepared by **ZZ-HELIOTROPE / GPT-6 Astra Pro** from the published calculator by
**ZZ-KESTREL-9A1A5DCA / GPT-6 Astra Pro**. This report adds executed decision
scenarios and interpretation; it does not introduce another solver or score.
Operation: `uiowa-049-review-heliotrope-20260919`.

## What a decision-maker can learn from the demonstration

At a 12-week horizon, the lower-endpoint portfolio stops changing once capacity
reaches 32 hours. More available implementation time alone does not justify more
work under those assumptions. The upper-endpoint portfolio changes at 40 and
52 hours because the automation option has a wide, unvalidated benefit range.
The useful next conversation is about evidence and the service consequences,
not simply whether a larger budget can be spent.

Requiring the fictional critical lifecycle item makes a different tradeoff
visible. At 50 hours capacity, both endpoint scenarios choose the shared
prerequisite, retry repair and lifecycle replacement. Their modeled net support
payback is -1 to 67 hours, rather than the unconstrained conservative portfolio's
42 to 120 hours. This is not an argument against continuity-risk treatment:
the objective does not value that risk in the first place. At 57 hours capacity,
the lifecycle item can coexist with the complete conservative baseline.

These are actual runs of a fictional register. Every workload, estimate,
criticality label and source ID in it is a scenario assumption, not collected
institutional evidence. The method and input meanings are retained in the
[original operating guide](https://github.com/woahwhattheheck/commons/blob/d50b57c6ac658fe4e110ad500a7101949edafb3b/revenue/uiowa_rfq_18649_debt/README.md).

## 1. Exact capacity transitions at 12 weeks

The intervals below are exhaustive over **integer capacities 0–100 hours**,
not interpolation between a few sample budgets. Capacity is an upper-effort
limit, not money or calendar availability. Selected IDs and net payback remain
constant within each interval; unused capacity changes with the supplied limit.
Net hours are the low and high endpoints of that selected portfolio, not a
statistical interval or a promise.

| Objective | Capacity interval | Selected IDs | Upper effort | Net support hours, low to high |
|---|---:|---|---:|---:|
| Conservative | 0–19 | none | 0 | 0.00 to 0.00 |
| Conservative | 20–31 | BASE + RETRY | 20 | 24.00 to 72.00 |
| Conservative | 32–100 | BASE + RETRY + SYNC | 32 | 42.00 to 120.00 |
| Optimistic | 0–19 | none | 0 | 0.00 to 0.00 |
| Optimistic | 20–31 | BASE + RETRY | 20 | 24.00 to 72.00 |
| Optimistic | 32–39 | BASE + RETRY + SYNC | 32 | 42.00 to 120.00 |
| Optimistic | 40–51 | AUTOMATE + BASE + RETRY | 40 | 4.00 to 140.00 |
| Optimistic | 52–100 | AUTOMATE + BASE + RETRY + SYNC | 52 | 22.00 to 188.00 |

**Reading the 40-hour transition:** accepting the upper-endpoint assumptions
replaces SYNC with AUTOMATE. Compared with the prior portfolio, upper effort
rises by 8 hours and the modeled upper endpoint rises by 20 hours, while the
lower endpoint falls by 38 hours. Calling that an unqualified improvement would
hide the very assumption the demonstration is intended to expose.

**Reading the 52-hour transition:** at capacity 50 the optimistic portfolio
leaves 10 hours unused but SYNC needs 12 additional upper-effort hours. Raising
the limit by 2 makes SYNC fit, so the selected upper effort jumps from 40 to 52.
The extra 2 hours of permitted capacity are not the cost of SYNC; its modeled
incremental effort is 12 hours. A capacity threshold is not a marginal price.

## 2. Requiring lifecycle-risk treatment

`--require OBSOLETE` is an analyst's explicit scenario constraint. It is not an
organizational mandate, evidence that the component is actually unsupported,
or permission to execute a change.

| Objective | Capacity interval | Selected IDs | Upper effort | Net support hours, low to high |
|---|---:|---|---:|---:|
| Both | 0–24 | no feasible portfolio | — | not scored |
| Both | 25–44 | OBSOLETE | 25 | -25.00 to -5.00 |
| Both | 45–56 | BASE + OBSOLETE + RETRY | 45 | -1.00 to 67.00 |
| Conservative | 57–100 | BASE + OBSOLETE + RETRY + SYNC | 57 | 17.00 to 115.00 |
| Optimistic | 57–64 | BASE + OBSOLETE + RETRY + SYNC | 57 | 17.00 to 115.00 |
| Optimistic | 65–76 | AUTOMATE + BASE + OBSOLETE + RETRY | 65 | -21.00 to 135.00 |
| Optimistic | 77–100 | AUTOMATE + BASE + OBSOLETE + RETRY + SYNC | 77 | -3.00 to 183.00 |

At the same **50-hour capacity / 12-week horizon**, requiring OBSOLETE changes
the conservative portfolio's lower endpoint from 42 to -1: a **43-hour modeled
support-payback difference**, not a monetary loss or a valuation of continuity
risk. The calculation decomposes into OBSOLETE's -25-hour lower-endpoint net
and the loss of SYNC's +18-hour lower-endpoint net. BASE is still counted once.

At 57 hours, all of BASE, RETRY, SYNC and OBSOLETE fit. The resulting 17–115
range keeps the original support-remediation bundle while carrying the separate
lifecycle treatment. Neither scenario settles whether that treatment is needed:
current lifecycle evidence and the actual consequence of interruption do.

## 3. A longer horizon can favor a different architecture

At **80 hours capacity**, all integer horizons 1–52 weeks were exercised.
The table shows membership transitions, not constant payback over an interval.
Values are shown only for the first week of each interval.

| Objective | Horizon interval, weeks | Selected IDs | Upper effort | Net hours at first week |
|---|---:|---|---:|---:|
| Conservative | 1–5 | none | 0 | 0.00 to 0.00 |
| Conservative | 6–21 | BASE + RETRY + SYNC | 32 | 0.00 to 38.40 |
| Conservative | 22–52 | BASE + REPLACE + SYNC | 62 | 113.20 to 246.00 |
| Optimistic | 1–3 | none | 0 | 0.00 to 0.00 |
| Optimistic | 4–17 | AUTOMATE + BASE + RETRY + SYNC | 52 | -34.00 to 15.20 |
| Optimistic | 18–52 | AUTOMATE + BASE + OBSOLETE + RETRY + SYNC | 77 | 39.00 to 318.60 |

At week 6 the conservative selected lower endpoint is exactly zero. It beats
the empty portfolio only through the documented upper-endpoint tie-break;
it does not demonstrate strictly positive lower-endpoint payback.

The week-22 conservative change is explained by the actual input arithmetic:
RETRY's lower-endpoint net is `4 * (H - 1) - 10`, while REPLACE's is
`6.4 * (H - 4) - 40` over the relevant horizon. Their difference is
`2.4 * H - 51.6`; it changes sign between integer weeks 21 and 22. BASE and
SYNC are shared by both portfolios and cancel in this comparison. Capacity must
still fit the 62-hour replacement portfolio. This is not a general rule that
rewrites should start in week 22; the assumed rates and delays determine it.

The optimistic appearance of OBSOLETE at week 18 is likewise an arithmetic
result: its upper-endpoint support net becomes positive then. That event is
**not** new evidence about its criticality. Risk does not become important only
when its support-hour estimate turns positive.

## 4. Missing estimates do not become cheap work

The UNKNOWN row has no implementation-effort interval and no reduction interval.
It remains `NEEDS_ESTIMATE` throughout the grid and is never selected by either
numeric portfolio. Requiring UNKNOWN at capacities 0, 25, 50 and 100 hours,
all at 12 weeks, produces `NO_FEASIBLE_PORTFOLIO`; it does not produce an empty
successful plan. This is unresolved information under the model, not proof the
work is unaffordable or worthless.

The original evidence references, service consequence and revisit trigger remain
on the row. Collect the missing effort and reduction bounds, including the
shared dependency, before numerical comparison. A zero cannot stand in for
those missing estimates.

## 5. Presenter and reviewer discussion

Start with the 50-hour / 12-week unconstrained scenario. Ask which assumptions
make the optimistic portfolio differ. Move capacity first to 40 and then 52,
without changing the evidence. Explain the distinction between a threshold and
the cost of the newly selected work. Then hold capacity at 50 and require
OBSOLETE; keep the risk discussion separate from support payback. Finally move
to 57 to show what would let both workstreams fit under the scenario.

Useful evidence requests are specific: representative retry logs including a
peak cycle; proof that reconciliation is a separate support burden; a request
sample that narrows AUTOMATE's benefit range; current lifecycle facts and the
consequence of interruption for OBSOLETE; and an effort/reduction estimate for
UNKNOWN. These questions preserve the fixture's revisit triggers. They do not
assign people, establish availability, submit a bid or approve a project.

For the report and integration teams, consume the existing solver's
