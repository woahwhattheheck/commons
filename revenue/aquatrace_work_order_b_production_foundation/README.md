# aquatrace-work-order-b-production-foundation-20260831-01

Working program for AquaTrace **Lane B — Production foundation**: roster lookup, deny-by-default RBAC, attributable audit, samples/custody/QC, and device contracts.

The runner is the product. `python3 aquatrace_work_order_b_production_foundation.py` performs intake → roster lookup → deny-by-default RBAC → attributable audit → sample/custody/QC transitions → device-contract check → HOLD on violations → named-human release. Tests prove that program. The HTML window is not the product.

Synthetic actors and packets only. No live LIMS. No production writes. No automatic release. No City / customer data. No outreach. No bid. No readiness or certification claim. State remains **NOT_READY**. **HOLD / BUILD-AND-VERIFY**. `cash_usd=0`.

Cite Billings instrument fixtures conceptually (`mock-ph-meter-1`, `mock-metrohm-ic`, `mock-analytical-balance-1`). Those files are not rewritten. Do not edit the private `woahwhattheheck/aquatrace-lims` repo.

## Boundary

- Unknown and disabled actors refused.
- Each role stays in named scope. Same actor cannot approve a change they proposed.
- Support is time-bounded and cannot silently elevate.
- Integration cannot administer users. QA cannot erase audit.
- Reporting can release only reconciled, QC-approved packets.
- QC holds and unknown devices block release.
- No result without a named human. Replay produces at most one effect.
- Open Door on Commons is unchanged. RBAC here is the synthetic LIMS product, not a Commons login gate.

## Golden hash

- `audit_sha256` `669cf3ea966ee6351ffad46bbc0e2ce6854a10ce290bd6faf380b57910f3ec23`

Replay of the entire scenario creates zero new effects and reprints the same audit hash. Program state stays `NOT_READY`.
