# UArk RFP09112026 — technical workshare hypothesis

**Boundary:** internal partner-ready hypothesis only. **$35,000 fixed target — `INTERNAL_HYPOTHESIS_NOT_OFFERED`.**
No buyer/partner offer, commitment, quote, submission, certification assertion, assessment authority, or FCI/CUI handling is created here.

The buyer expressly permits proposals for a specific service and may split awards by service. This workshare therefore targets the evidence-engineering, monitoring, automation, validation, and knowledge-transfer slices rather than claiming full-program prime capability.

## Work packets

| WP | Phase alignment | Deliverable | Acceptance boundary | Internal target |
|---|---|---|---|---:|
| 1 | Months 1–3 | Control→artifact evidence inventory and lineage schema | Prime-supplied control IDs map deterministically to retained evidence metadata; no unsupported PASS inference | $7,000 |
| 2 | Months 1–3 / 4–9 | Baseline and configuration-drift verification harness | Replayable synthetic/deidentified fixture proves expected/observed drift and receipt integrity | $8,000 |
| 3 | Months 4–9 | Continuous-monitoring evidence receipt pipeline design | Event/evidence manifests are canonical, hash-addressed, and reconstructable without vendor-lock assumptions | $8,000 |
| 4 | Months 4–9 | Compliance evidence collection + control-validation automation pack | Deterministic control-validation test vectors and exception ledger; human professional judgment remains with prime/UA | $7,000 |
| 5 | Months 9–13 | Assessment-readiness replay + knowledge-transfer pack | Reproducible dry-run evidence bundles, operator guide, handoff tests, and failure-mode runbook | $5,000 |

Total internal target: **$35,000**.

## RACI

**Prime:** buyer relationship and portal; full proposal; three-reference gate; insurance; contractual/statutory certifications; pricing/signature authority; professional CMMC interpretation; personnel representations; overall architecture and delivery warranty; final assessment/readiness judgments.

**ZNC/TJLabs technical seam:** deterministic evidence schemas and receipts; synthetic/deidentified verification fixtures; evidence-collection automation implementation; monitoring/drift test harnesses; reproducibility and acceptance tests; technical documentation and knowledge transfer.

**UA:** requirement interpretation; access authorization; CUI/FCI environment decisions; deliverable acceptance; control owners; final institutional judgments.

## Non-negotiable acceptance rules

1. No live FCI/CUI enters this workshare until a separately authorized environment, access model, data-handling procedure, and prime/UA approval exist.
2. A test result is evidence about the tested condition, not a CMMC certification or external assessment conclusion.
3. Every automated output retains source identity, timestamp/provenance, control mapping, canonical digest, and explicit human-review state.
4. Unknown, stale, conflicting, or missing source evidence fails closed.
5. Deliverable corrections caused by our implementation defects are included within the buyer’s 10-business-day correction expectation; commercial/legal allocation remains prime-controlled.
6. No proprietary external tool is silently made mandatory; recommendations identify license/recurring-cost assumptions as the RFP requires.

## Partner acceptance checklist

A prospective prime must confirm in writing before this becomes an executable subcontract: prime responsibility and sole buyer-contact role; current buyer packet/addenda review; reference/insurance/contract eligibility; personnel/compliance leadership; exact workshare scope; data-access model; ownership/IP allocation; schedule; acceptance tests; and signed commercial terms.

Any outreach to find that prime is a separate live operation requiring fresh fleet/provider collision checks and explicit Muse single-writer selection.
