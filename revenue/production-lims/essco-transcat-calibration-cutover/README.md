# Essco / Transcat Calibration Cutover — synthetic read-only shadow

Demand: `essco-transcat-calibration-cutover-lims-01`

This directory is a **synthetic, read-only reconciliation harness**. It does not connect to, write to, or release anything in Essco, EsscoNet, Transcat, MET/CAL, courier, certificate, customer, payment, or production systems. Existing systems remain authoritative.

## Acceptance contract

The frozen fixture materializes exactly **500** deterministic synthetic calibration histories from a compact deterministic generation recipe:

- **400 CLEAN** histories that must map exactly once through instrument → customer/site → service order → pickup/receipt → scope/procedure → MET/CAL run → as-found/as-left → certificate → EsscoNet document → Transcat receipt.
- **100 HOLD** histories with exact truth-set codes:
  - `DUPLICATE_ASSET_ID`: 15
  - `CUSTOMER_SITE_MISMATCH`: 15
  - `OUT_OF_SCOPE_PROCEDURE`: 14
  - `MISSING_AS_FOUND`: 14
  - `CERTIFICATE_VERSION_CONFLICT`: 14
  - `COURIER_CUSTODY_BREAK`: 14
  - `LEGACY_NEW_SYSTEM_MISMATCH`: 14

The compact fixture is the frozen source of truth; its recipe expands deterministically into all 500 full instrument histories before validation. The signed manifest binds the exact fixture bytes and the SHA-256 of the complete expanded 500-history record set.

The harness verifies:

1. frozen dataset SHA-256 and expanded-record-set SHA-256 against the manifest;
2. a deterministic content-envelope manifest signature (`sha256-content-envelope-v1`, synthetic-integrity-only);
3. exact truth-set HOLD classification;
4. clean mapping count = 1 end to end;
5. values, units, uncertainty, procedure revision, and certificate hashes survive the clean mapping unchanged;
6. no asset or certificate crosses customers;
7. repeat replay is byte-deterministic/idempotent;
8. rollback restores the exact prior shadow snapshot;
9. authoritative input state remains unchanged; and
10. automatic release is impossible — all CLEAN rows remain `QA_REQUIRED`, and only human QA may control any real release outside this harness.
