# UIOWA-127 — provenance-preserving local evidence search

A deterministic, offline search component over **already-merged synthetic RFQ 18649 preparation records**. It indexes source metadata, traceability observations, findings, and locator-preserving extracted text without an external model or network service at runtime.

The retained component is Solstice's [PR #16212](https://github.com/woahwhattheheck/commons/pull/16212). The complementary [provenance and exact-ID repair](PROVENANCE.md) preserves its original nine tests and ranking formula, verifies supplied source bytes, and distinguishes delivered record citations from absent underlying documents.

## Provenance contract

Every normalized record carries:

- its stable record ID and record type;
- the exact upstream repository path and Git blob SHA used to prepare the fixture;
- its native source locator;
- the native source reference when one exists (`synthetic://…` for workshare authority records), otherwise the GitHub file URL;
- linked IDs for finding → evidence relationships.

The committed fixture manifest pins upstream blob SHAs and immutable revisions. Manifest loading verifies local bytes, and results add `record_url`, physical CSV row locations, original content, exact snippet offsets and explicit missing-source diagnostics. Integrity checks are not publisher authentication. Search never fills a missing record with an answer.

## Corpus used by the worked example

- 12 source-metadata records from `uiowa_rfq_18649_workshare/fixtures/synthetic_authority.json`;
- 8 observation/evidence records from `uiowa_rfq_18649_traceability_rehearsal/evidence.csv`;
- 3 findings from `uiowa_rfq_18649_traceability_rehearsal/findings.csv`;
- 4 retained extraction segments prepared from the merged document-extraction sample text. The replay suite separately executes the real extractor and checks its actual returned segments and locators.

Total: **27 records**. All are synthetic preparation artifacts, not University of Iowa findings.

## Ranking

The search is transparent lexical retrieval: Unicode case-folded word tokens; each matched term contributes `idf(term) × (1 + ln(tf))`; an exact normalized query phrase adds 1.0; ties break by stable record ID. No opaque embeddings, personalisation, model inference, or current clock enters ranking. Native extra fields and source warnings are also searchable after rebuilding.

Exact-ID `lookup` is separate from lexical `query`: it never tokenizes or aliases the requested identity and returns no relevance score.

## Run

```bash
python3 evidence_search.py build fixtures/manifest.json review-index.json
python3 evidence_search.py query review-index.json "vulnerability ownership"
python3 evidence_search.py query review-index.json "end to end propagation"
python3 evidence_search.py lookup review-index.json F-002
python3 evidence_search.py lookup review-index.json E-005
python3 evidence_search.py query review-index.json "independent review before merge"
python3 -m unittest discover -v
python3 -O -m unittest discover -v
```

Choose a disposable output path; `build` writes that named file. See [PROVENANCE.md](PROVENANCE.md) for the exact-source reviewer flow, fields, migration rules and execution boundaries. `examples/question-walkthrough.md` remains the original worked flow; rebuild its legacy index to add the new provenance fields.

## Scope boundary

This is navigation over supplied evidence, not an answer generator. A high-ranked hit is not a finding, a confidence score, or proof that an observed practice exists outside the referenced synthetic record. No result means only that the indexed packet did not match the query.
