"""UIOWA-108 -- classify a contractor transition into the three states the
work order names, and render the handoff report.

Run:
    python3 transition.py --input fixtures/contractor_transition.json --outdir out
    python3 transition.py --input fixtures/contractor_transition.json --print

Python 3 standard library only. No network. Deterministic.

The order: *"The example distinguishes completed access changes, unresolved
ownership, and missing evidence."*  Those are three different operational
situations with three different next actions, and a careless handoff report
collapses all three into one green checkmark:

  COMPLETED            -- a dated change record with an evidence locator says
                          the change happened.
  UNRESOLVED_OWNERSHIP -- the departing contractor still owns it and no
                          successor is recorded. A live gap with a
                          name-shaped hole in it.
  NO_EVIDENCE          -- we have no record either way. This includes the
                          case that matters most in practice: a successor has
                          been *named* but nothing shows the handoff actually
                          happened. A plan is not evidence.

None of the three is scored, ranked, weighted, or rolled into a percentage,
and the transition cannot be reported closed while any item sits outside
COMPLETED.
