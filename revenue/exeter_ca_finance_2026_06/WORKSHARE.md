Status: **PROPOSED_NOT_ACCEPTED**  
Commercial hypothesis: **USD 24,000 fixed**  
Reference delivery window: **12 business days after agreed input readiness**  
Operation: \`EXETER-CA-2026-06-MUNICIPAL-FINANCE-ACCEPTANCE-ZSOL-20260917\`

## Positioning

This is a bounded specialist subcontract concept for a qualified municipal-finance/ERP prime pursuing City of Exeter RFP 2026-06. It is not an ERP software proposal and does not represent TJLabs as meeting the solicitation's prime-vendor qualifications.

The qualified prime retains software/product authority, municipal references, staffing, hosting/security/compliance claims, buyer communications, proposal pricing, legal terms, submission, production access, go-live decisions, award, and payment authority.

## Paid workshare

### 1. Migration-generation custody and crosswalk integrity

Prime supplies frozen source/target generation identities, mapping rules, approved transformations, and bounded synthetic/de-identified or otherwise authorized evidence. TJLabs supplies content-addressed generation manifests, account/fund/vendor/customer/employee mapping checks, duplicate/conflict detection, explicit exception state, and deterministic replay receipts.

### 2. GL/fund and subledger reconciliation

Covered seams: GL/fund accounting, AP, AR, payroll, utility billing, cashiering/cash management, bank reconciliation, and financial-reporting controls.

TJLabs checks source/target integer-cent GL control rows, separately evidenced approved deltas, source/target subledger counts and amounts, and **exact subledger-to-GL linkage**. A subledger cannot pass merely because its own arithmetic balances; its linked GL/control source, target, approved delta, and adjustment receipt must agree exactly.

### 3. Bank-reconciliation evidence

Prime defines the City-approved reconciliation model and evidence boundary. TJLabs checks statement-side and book-side equations against the same declared terminal amount. Additions/deductions are nonnegative directional magnitudes; the harness cannot turn a negative deduction into a hidden addition.

TJLabs does not move money, clear transactions, connect to a bank, certify cash balances, or substitute for City/prime accounting judgment.

### 4. Interface / integration acceptance

For every admitted interface, prime supplies source, target, contract/format, and bounded evidence. TJLabs checks manifest identity, required-interface completeness, duplicates, verified/failed/HOLD state, and replay properties where the evidence permits. No network call or production integration is performed.

### 5. UAT traceability

Mandatory workshare evidence surfaces: GL/fund accounting, AP, AR, payroll, cashiering, bank reconciliation, utility billing, financial reporting, integrations, and data conversion. TJLabs supplies stable evidence IDs and rejects caller-authored PASS without retained evidence. Human UAT/business acceptance remains prime/City authority.

### 6. Current procurement-source pin

The executable packet carries the retained source-ledger/index/RFP/Q&A-addenda generation and a bounded observation age. A synthetically perfect accounting packet cannot become READY while the retained procurement source is stale or the Q&A/addenda state is unresolved.

### 7. Cutover / rollback / replay

TJLabs checks source-freeze, rollback, and replay receipts plus unresolved cutover exceptions, then emits a deterministic final report digest. \`READY\` means only that the bounded evidence packet satisfied these rules.

## Delivery sequence

- **Days 1–2:** source/evidence inventory, source-pin refresh, generation freeze, mappings, authority gaps.
- **Days 3–5:** GL controls and AP/AR/payroll/utility/cashiering linkage/reconciliation.
- **Days 6–7:** bank/interface acceptance and hostile exception passes.
- **Days 8–9:** UAT traceability and retained evidence.
- **Days 10–11:** cutover/rollback/replay binder and rerun.
- **Day 12:** prime review, gap disposition, reproducible final evidence package.

Clock starts only after input-readiness passes. Missing/contradictory evidence produces HOLD rather than fabricated PASS.

## Commercial truth and outbound control

The USD 24,000 / 12-business-day figure is a working hypothesis only. It is not a contract, accepted quote, receivable, or revenue. No external offer is authorized until the target relationship is independently qualified and the fleet's canonical single-writer outbound custody has produced one current provider-bound writer generation. Advisory bots or ordinary routing acknowledgements are not send authority.
