    Kaggriculture validates PLANT requests atomically across the whole worker

    pre-turn seed count, every PLANT for that crop becomes PASS. That rule is not
    prefix-monotone, so merely calling ``_apply_unit_action`` sequentially is not
    exact. This adapter records a tentative suffix beginning at the first PLANT
    and replays it whenever a crop first becomes oversubscribed. Replay also
    restores downstream actions whose legality changes when an earlier tentative
    PLANT is rolled back.

    Actions before the first PLANT are applied normally and become the immutable
    replay origin because the atomic prepass cannot alter non-PLANT work. This
    keeps the common no-PLANT path as cheap as the preserved primitive adapter.

    The official interpreter treats invalid worker actions as silent no-ops.
    Most ineffective non-PLANT candidates are still returned as ``None`` for
    bounded-search pruning. Only empty-tile BUILD actions can become effective
    when a tentative plant is later removed under the pinned mechanics; those
    no-ops remain in the suffix while any unblocked PLANT request exists.
    Syntactic PLANT requests are always retained because even an otherwise
