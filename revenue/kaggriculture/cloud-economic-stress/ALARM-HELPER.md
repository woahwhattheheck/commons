# Direct cancellation helper composition

This follows the source-pinned PR10038 caller-timer repair documented in `CALLER-TIMER.md`. That original 20-method result remains unchanged. The current adapter additionally binds `_alarm(None, None)` to the active guard's cancellation object. This preserves the direct helper used by CANCEL's published `_commit`, transform and before-transform regressions without weakening the distinction between a guard timeout and a caller timeout.

A context-local active timer is installed/restored with the guard scope. When delivering an enclosing caller's handler, the adapter temporarily restores the caller's timer context. An enclosing `_alarm` therefore cannot acquire the inner guard's identity. Outside any guard, `_alarm` still raises `DeadlineExceeded(BaseException)`. Explicitly raised foreign exceptions remain foreign. The cancellation class/docstring, worker actions and liquidation fallbacks are unchanged; only the helper body and its context binding extend PR10038.

## Executed result

`test_alarm_helper.py` composes the unchanged `test_deadline_contract.py` suite with three new helper methods. **23 methods pass**, zero failures/errors, with six actual PR9997 actor/interpreter transitions and one real parent call in each. The 20 original methods remain byte-identical. `ALARM-HELPER-RESULTS.json` is the canonicalized executed report, including exact source hashes and all six actions/cash rows.

The three additions exercise direct helper cancellation at production/transform/before-transform boundaries, an enclosing caller registered with the same helper, and helper behavior outside a guard. Against exact PR10038 adapter33ce93fe the combined suite retains the original passing cases but reports five error records across the new helper methods/subtests. The corrected adapter resolves those errors without changing the tests. CANCEL retains its separate 18-method suite and prior evidence; its new-source execution is not included in this 23 count.

All options also support the existing repository layout defaults. The same frozen archive and engine inputs listed in `CALLER-TIMER.md` were reused, not regenerated. No games, new evaluation seeds, workflow changes or policy selection.
