# Fresh land-only causal check

This source-frozen diagnostic adds one guarded third-land order at step 266 to
the exact submitted 7b58 controller and plays it head-to-head against the
unchanged submitted controller. The guard preserves all existing current-turn
orders and a $4,000 cash buffer. It is intentionally a causal arm, not the
prospective payback rule requested for integration.

Seeds 9922029–9922032, both seats, completed all eight 719-action official-engine
games with no errors or timeouts. The treatment lost every game by exactly
$4,000; the opponent score was unchanged. Candidate maximum call/RPC time was
173.129351/205.014911 ms and peak RSS was 23,736 KiB. Banks were equal at the
day ending step 263, differed by exactly the land cost at step 287, and retained
that difference through terminal settlement. The purchase therefore activated
but generated no realized return in this slice. This arm is rejected and must
not be enabled in the canonical controller.
