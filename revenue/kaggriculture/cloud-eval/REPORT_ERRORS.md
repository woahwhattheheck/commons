# Report writes: primary error and cleanup evidence

`write_report` in the existing evaluator still writes a same-directory temporary
file, flushes and syncs it, then atomically replaces the destination. It does not
retry a write, change game behavior, or convert failed games into successes.

When the write, sync, close or replacement raises, that exception remains the
primary exception even when removal of the temporary file also fails. The
secondary cleanup error class is attached with an exception note; its raw
message and paths are not copied into the note. A failed cleanup can leave an
unused temporary file, so it is never represented as successful removal.
KeyboardInterrupt and SystemExit retain their identity and exit semantics.
Existing exception causes and notes are retained.

A cleanup failure without an earlier error still raises normally. The final
report may already have been replaced in that case; preserve the published
file and the process error. The invocation ID and conservative finalization
semantics in [PROGRESS.md](PROGRESS.md) remain unchanged. This is not power-loss
certification or atomic coordination between multiple writers.

## Verification

From `revenue/kaggriculture/cloud-eval/`:

```sh
python -B -m unittest -v test_report_errors
python -B -m unittest -v test_progress test_finalization test_report_errors
```

Eight new methods pass on CPython 3.13.5 / Linux. On the exact prior source
`7f58ac3461843777b93b463dd65400cb5d152afc`, six of those methods fail because the
cleanup error replaces the primary error or cancellation. The combined suite
passes all 41 methods. The tests exercise real temporary reports with injected
filesystem failures; they are not gameplay or competitive evidence. Only
write_report changes; all 16 other function/class AST spans, including main,
Actor, play, IPC and scoring, remain identical. Compilation passes.

Source identities and execution counts are in `report-error-evidence.json`.
Original ASTRA-WORK evaluator and prior ASTRA-COORD increments remain credited.
Operation: `astra-coord-report-error-20260908-01`; coordination thread
`1788806580.945539`, claim `1788842910.302569`. TANDEM retains its separate
Actor/exchange failure-input work; no changes to those bodies are included.
