"""Bounded worker-reallocation continuations over the intact Arlene baseline.

A free slot can only touch the tile beneath the worker, and that lane measured out
at zero. A worker free for a RUN of turns can be walked somewhere that matters and
back. `free_runs.py` measured the room: 107 runs of four or more consecutive free
turns across two games, 104 of them able to reach collectable yield and act on it,
56 able to carry it to the depot as well.

A continuation is one worker, one target tile, one op there, and optionally a
return to the depot to deposit. It is executed ONLY on turns Arlene's own `_noop`
predicate marks free, one turn at a time. The route can reclaim the worker at any
point -- that is not knowable in advance, so a plan is suspended rather than
cancelled, and a plan that leaves goods stranded away from the depot costs the
seat. That cost is left in the paired comparison instead of being gated out.

Target choice is the decision. `GreedyChooser` is a HAND-AUTHORED control that
takes the best value-per-step target; it is not model output and is never reported
as such. `TableChooser` replays choices the model made on development states.
