"""Realised continuation value of Arlene's own route-tail choices.

Arlene switches route tails at three checkpoints, each a hand-set threshold on one
observable feature (arlene.py DECISIONS):

    turn 226   shop_YARN_STORE >= 1     -> YARN
    turn 360   px_CARROT       >= 42    -> YARN_CARROT
    turn 433   inv_MILK        >= 10067 -> MILK_GLUT

A switch is only ever onto a tail identical to the current one so far
(`_switch_ok`), so prefix compatibility is the baseline's own invariant and this
changes nothing else about the agent: same tapes, same repairs, same market logic.

The idle-slot lane measured out at zero -- Arlene leaves a slot free because
nothing on that tile is worth doing, and any fill either spends a resource or
reorders the shared price curve. A tail choice is the opposite kind of lever: one
decision that swaps a whole route suffix.

This measures what each choice is actually WORTH by playing the rest of the game
out both ways, in the official interpreter, against a real opponent -- realised
continuation value, not a proxy. It reports own cash and own-minus-rival margin
separately and records the feature value the threshold reads, so a wrong threshold
shows up as a decision whose realised value has the opposite sign.
