"""Cards for a bounded worker-reallocation continuation.

The single-slot lane measured out at zero because a free slot only reaches the
tile beneath the worker. `free_runs.py` measured what is actually available
instead: across two full Arlene games, 107 runs of four or more consecutive free
turns for one worker, 104 of which could reach a tile holding collectable yield or
available fertilizer and act on it inside the run, and 56 of which could also
carry the goods back to the depot inside the same run.

A card is one such moment. It carries the exact observation, which worker is free,
and every reachable target enumerated from the observed state with its grounded
economics: what is on the tile, how many units, what those units fetch at the
CURRENT quoted price, how far the worker is, and how far that tile is from the
depot. No future price, no future shop, no seed identity, no RNG.

The route can reclaim the worker on any later turn -- that is not knowable in
advance and is not hidden from the model. A plan that strands goods away from the
depot costs the seat, and that cost shows up in the paired full-game comparison
rather than being gated out beforehand.
