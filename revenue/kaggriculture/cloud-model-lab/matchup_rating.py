"""An EMPIRICAL matchup rating estimate from head-to-head W/T/L. Not a Kaggle score.

Why this exists, and what it is not. Kaggle's simulation leaderboard updates a
Gaussian skill from win/loss/tie outcomes, and Kaggriculture's final standing is
Bradley-Terry. Neither reads coin margin. So a panel that is cash-positive while
every arm wins carries NO rating information, and this tool is built to say so
rather than to manufacture a number.

Model, stated so it can be disagreed with:

  Bradley-Terry on log-strength. P(A beats B) = sigma(s_A - s_B), a tie counts as
  half a win to each side (the standard Davidson-free reduction; it does not model
  tie propensity, and where ties dominate that is a real limitation, reported).
  Fitted by regularised MM iteration with an L2 prior of sd 2.0 on log-strength,
  so a pairing with no losses returns a finite, honestly-bounded estimate instead
  of +infinity.

Anchor, stated: one named entrant is pinned at 0 log-strength and every other
estimate is RELATIVE to it. There is no absolute scale here and no mapping to a
public score.

Uncertainty, grouped: a nonparametric CLUSTER bootstrap over SEEDS, not over
games. Cells inside one seed share a board and are not independent; seats that
return byte-identical cash are collapsed to a single observation first. The
interval is therefore wide and honest rather than narrow and wrong.
