"""Downstream value of a model segment: let a pinned policy finish the game.

Early cash is not the measure. A segment that spends 400 on a cow looks worse at
step 8 and may be ahead by step 700. So each candidate state is handed to the SAME
pinned continuation policy, separately instantiated, which plays the rest of the
official game against the same opponent, config and seed. The matched control is
that policy playing the whole game from step 0.

The difference is a conditional estimate of the segment's downstream value under
that policy. It is not proof of an all-model full-game result, and it is only as
general as the one policy and one seed it uses.

Recorded separately, never merged into one number: final cash and margin, the
purchased-but-uninstalled backlog, goods discarded at the end-of-day drop, and
production actually harvested.
