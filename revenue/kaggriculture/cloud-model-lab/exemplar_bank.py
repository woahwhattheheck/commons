"""Port of the LDA ExemplarBank to Kaggriculture turns.

Source: app/src/main/java/com/local/deviceagent/ExemplarBank.kt and its call sites in
AgentOrchestrator.kt at LDA 54081cd58d2c45b868b4265c3dcb8990aa1cc9b4. The mechanism
ported, not paraphrased:

  * entries are lean (state digest -> action) DEMONSTRATIONS, append-only JSONL,
    capped and rolling;
  * keyed by a SITUATION CLASS -- the structural abstraction of how a situation of
    this KIND behaves -- so an example generalises rather than memorising a path;
  * recorded ONLY from scored ADVANCING steps (the `pos && m > 0` gate);
  * retrieval returns the newest 1-2 for the class, same-context first then any
    context, DEDUPLICATED by action shape so two entries never teach the same move;
  * placed immediately BEFORE the live state, so continuing the pattern IS the
    action for the live state.

Provenance is explicit and never fabricated. A row is either `model` -- an action
this driver's model actually authored and the engine actually advanced -- or
`teacher:<name>`, a bootstrap demonstration from a named official agent, labelled as
such in the row and in the injected header. A teacher row is never presented as a
past model success.
