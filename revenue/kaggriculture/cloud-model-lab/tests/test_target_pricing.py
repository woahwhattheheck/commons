"""Regression for the target-pricing lookup.

The defect: `reachable_targets` priced every candidate through
`native_motifs.engine()`, which returns the BUNDLED `engine_pin.py` -- the
unit-phase transition closure, which carries no `market_price`. Each lookup
raised, the value came back None, and the filter dropped the whole target list.
The lane then reported that the board held nothing collectable at 457 positions
on a board that holds animal yield on 451 of 719 turns.

Two things are asserted here, and the second is the one that matters:

  1. On a REAL observed yield-bearing state, candidate targets come back
     non-empty and priced through the exact interface
     `market_price(item, inventory, params)`.
  2. When the pricing API is absent, that surfaces as a DIAGNOSTIC. Silence is
     the failure mode: an absent price must never be indistinguishable from
     "there is no opportunity here".

Run: python -B tests/test_target_pricing.py
