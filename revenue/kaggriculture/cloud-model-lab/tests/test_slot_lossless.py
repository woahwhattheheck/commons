"""The typed-slot renderer must lose no decision-relevant value.

Every tile with its exact contents, every worker with what it carries, every
admissible op of every worker, every market order with its maximum quantity, the
seed budget, the ordering rule, the shed capacity and room, the production and decay
clocks, the survival counter, the prices, the objective and the horizon must all be
present. This checks presence, not wording: the point is that compression removed
repeated statements of the same fact, not any fact.

Run: python -B tests/test_slot_lossless.py
