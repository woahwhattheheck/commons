"""Selective motif overlay on the INTACT Arlene baseline.

Arlene replays route tapes and already carries the two things this needs:

  `_noop(act, tile, inv, seeds, x, y)`  its own predicate for a slot the engine
      will ignore. It reuses such a slot for exactly one purpose today -- a wasted
      turn spent standing on a weed becomes a DIG. This extends that same notion
      of a free slot to compiled, economically live components.

  `future_sells(item, step)`  how much of each product the REST of the route still
      intends to sell. The reservation contract below is the same idea widened to
      every resource the remaining tape consumes, read off the tape itself rather
      than off one turn.

The baseline is not modified. `Overlay` calls Arlene for the whole turn, keeps its
farmer, hands and market exactly as returned, and only writes into slots Arlene's
own predicate marks free. Every write must survive:

  route reservation   the op may not consume a seed, a shed item or a carried item
                      the remaining tape still plans to use, nor a product the rest
                      of the route intends to sell
  prefix compatibility the merged unit phase, replayed with the pinned transition,
                      must leave every WORKING slot's exact outcome unchanged --
                      effect, final position, full carried inventory, tile beneath
  engine effect       the op must be one the interpreter acts on in context, and
                      never `destroyed_plant` or `removed_structure`
  destructive harvest HARVEST on a non-ongoing crop DESTROYS it (467-468), so it is
                      allowed only once the crop can grow no further, or on the
                      last day when nothing further can be sold anyway

A costly proposal is not banned. It is admitted when the compiled evidence says the
op pays and the reservation says the tape does not need what it spends; whether
that is worth cash is decided by full-game own cash and own-minus-rival margin, not
by any counter here.
