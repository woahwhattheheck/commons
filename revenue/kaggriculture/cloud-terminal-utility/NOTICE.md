# Source and licensing

The new adapter, CLI, and fixture/test scripts in this directory are released
under Apache-2.0, as marked in each Python file.

Tests consume, without republishing or modifying:

* Kaggle's Apache-2.0 official interpreter at
  `Kaggle/kaggle-environments@28b6d8af3ce73926b3d0fda1410c1ddd8384ab8c`;

* Commons' Apache-2.0 T15 solver at
  `woahwhattheheck/commons@46332a6b2ed2e3b329cca62faf85d2482c23000f`,

* The existing Commons evaluator from retained artifact10005621438,
  `peer/evaluate.py`, SHA-256
  `cd113a94ae99b03492502e425bdcf09c3db17a2aa2a8fd866f0d78caec9e311e`.
  The evaluator compiles the unchanged upstream seed helper from the supplied
  cached utils.py. It is not replaced with an invented initializer.

The engine artifact was already published. No export workflow or source fetch
was started for this component. SciPy is used only as an optional independent
linear-programming test oracle; production imports only Python's standard
library. Full engine and dependency license notices remain in their existing
source locations.
