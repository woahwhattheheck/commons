"""Conservatively rescue executable market orders stranded behind empty cap slots.

The Kaggriculture interpreter truncates each raw market list to
``maxMarketOrdersPerTurn`` before parsing orders.  An exact empty-list placeholder
inside that prefix therefore consumes one issued slot even though it parses as a
no-op.  This module performs one narrow, stable transformation:

* only exact ``[]`` placeholders may move;
* every non-empty value keeps its relative order and value;
* a queue changes only when at least one structurally executable order from
  beyond the cap crosses into the executable prefix; and
* the input object is never mutated.

The function is deliberately observation-free.  It repairs queue transport; it
does not choose purchases, sales, quantities, or timing.
