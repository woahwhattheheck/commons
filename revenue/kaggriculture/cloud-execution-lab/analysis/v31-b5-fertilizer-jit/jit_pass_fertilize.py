"""Default-off B5 experiment: spend an existing PASS on just-in-time fertilizer.

This helper is deliberately narrower than a route scheduler.  It changes a literal
selected PASS only when the same worker's *next authored* command is a same-day WATER
on the annual plant the worker is already standing on, the plant's next WATER is
provably yield-bearing and uncovered, and the worker already carries fertilizer.
Anything ambiguous returns the exact parent action object unchanged.
