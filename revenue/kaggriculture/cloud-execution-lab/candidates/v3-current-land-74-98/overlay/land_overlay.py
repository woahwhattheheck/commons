"""Copy-on-write early-land overlay for the current TITAN route bank.

The only policy change is to append one ``BUY_LAND`` order at steps 74 and 98
when the selected route row has room and does not already contain that order.
The source route bank and every untouched route/row/order object remain intact,
so controls created in the same interpreter cannot inherit candidate mutations.
