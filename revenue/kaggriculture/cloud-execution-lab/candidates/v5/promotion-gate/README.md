# TITAN V5 cross-evidence promotion gate

`promotion_gate.py` is an evidence-only fail-closed join across three V5
contracts that are intentionally produced separately:

1. a `v5_candidate_identity.py` manifest,
2. an `engagement_fingerprint.py` report, and
3. a `runtime-budget/runtime_budget_profile.py` report.

It does not execute gameplay, change a default, or replace the underlying
source/engine/simulation evidence. Its only job is to prevent a promotion
decision from accidentally combining evidence from different builds.

## Promotion contract

A PASS requires all of the following:

- the candidate manifest has the exact `titan-v5-candidate-identity/v1` closed
  shape and its `v5c:` ID recomputes from the manifest body;
- engagement is `ENGAGED`, has a real divergence, has distinct exact `v5c:`
  control/candidate IDs, and the candidate ID equals the manifest;
- runtime admission is `PASS` with `promotion_ready=true`, an explicit exact
  callback design, no missing or unexpected callbacks, nonnegative p99
  headroom, and exactly one runtime candidate equal to the manifest/engagement
  candidate;
- redundant runtime counts/rates are internally consistent; and
- every input JSON file is strict JSON: duplicate object members and
  `NaN`/`Infinity` constants are rejected.

The emitted receipt binds the exact input-file SHA-256 values plus the shared
candidate/control identity and the key engagement/runtime metrics. Output-file
publication is same-directory atomic.

## Usage

```bash
python candidates/v5/promotion-gate/promotion_gate.py \
  candidate-manifest.json engagement-report.json runtime-budget-report.json \
  --output promotion-receipt.json
```

Exit status is `0` only for a PASS receipt. Invalid, ambiguous, incomplete, or
cross-wired evidence exits `2`.

This gate deliberately re-checks `missing_expected` and `unexpected_extra`
instead of trusting an upstream PASS bit. That makes old/stale runtime reports
fail closed and composes safely with stricter runtime-budget profiler versions.
