"""Default-OFF V5 candidate: preserve over-cap worker stock across shed liquidation.

Pinned Kaggriculture mechanics give DROP and PLACE materially different overflow
semantics at shed access:

* DROP deposits up to current shed room, then deletes every carried stack key.
* PLACE <item> <qty> deposits only the fitting requested amount and leaves the
  rest of that item in the worker pocket.

For one unambiguous marketable-product pocket, rewriting a selected DROP to a
partial PLACE (or PASS when the shed is already full) preserves the same current
shed post-unit state while retaining stock that DROP would destroy.  This helper
is research-only: it does not activate itself in Titan and makes no full-game
profitability claim.
