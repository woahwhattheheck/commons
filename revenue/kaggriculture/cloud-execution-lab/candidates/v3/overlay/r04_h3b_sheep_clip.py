"""V4 H3b: reprioritize an existing V233 sheep HARVEST before max-held clipping.

This is the repaired H3b theorem from #12457, ported as a V4 default-OFF
post-policy transform. It never adds workers, animals, land, seed, market rows,
or service work. A V233 sheep worker may only swap one already-authored
HARVEST target for another sheep in the same assigned block when that sheep is
provably due to lose held WOOL at tonight's production refresh. Movement
reroutes are restricted to an adjacent urgent sheep: V233 reselects its target
every callback, so a longer walk is not persistence-safe without a target lock.

Disabled, malformed, nonstandard, stale-snapshot, service-debt, cargo-return,
setup, final-day, and unreachable paths preserve the exact parent action object.
