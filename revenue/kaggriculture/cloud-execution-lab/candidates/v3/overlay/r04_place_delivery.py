"""V4 PLACE-safe terminal shed delivery.

The published R04 final-turn liquidator uses DROP for every loaded worker beside
the shed. The engine accepts only the remaining capacity and destroys the rest
of a DROP payload. PLACE is capacity-bounded without destroying the worker's
unplaced cargo. This lane is shipped off as ``r04_place_delivery``.

When enabled, terminal-step DROP actions beside the shed are changed only when
their combined payload would overflow the remaining shed capacity. If every
payload fits, the exact parent action is returned so normal DROP behavior,
including multi-product cargo, stays untouched. Overflow also fails closed when
one worker carries multiple sellable products: the engine permits only one PLACE
command per worker, so rewriting that DROP could leave profitable shed capacity
unused. Finally, a candidate rewrite must project to the exact same full shed
mapping as the parent DROP action, and the parent market vector is preserved
verbatim. Thus public-price priority is never allowed to change terminal product
composition, quantities, raw SELL-row indices, or hidden-rival lockstep timing.
Malformed terminal step/shed/inventory/price/position/board state fails closed
to the exact parent action.
