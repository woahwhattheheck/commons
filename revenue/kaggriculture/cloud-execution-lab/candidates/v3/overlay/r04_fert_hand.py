"""V3.1 endgame fertilizer hand: one extra farm hand that fertilizes young annual crops.

Seen on the live ladder: senkin13 and Syed Asad Ali play our exact Shop Router tape plus one
extra HIRE on days 24-27; the extra hand picks up FERTILIZER at the shed and fertilizes the
tape's young CARROTs before their yield-bearing WATER (+1 carrot per tile; +13 carrots at
~$608 in episode 107763377).

Pinned-engine facts this relies on (kaggriculture.py): hands reset at every end of day, the
n-th hire of a day costs fib(n) (the tape already hires 12-14 a day in the endgame, so the
extra hand costs 233-610); FERTILIZE covers day..day+2; an annual crop's WATER adds 2 instead
of 1 inside [(max_yield_day+1)//2, max_yield_day] when fertilized, capped at max_yield (CARROT:
1 at planting, +1 per window WATER, cap 4, so one fertilizer before the first window WATER is
+1 unit). Units never collide; a new hand spawns on the least-occupied shed-access tile.

The wrapper keeps the parent stack blind to the extra hand: the parent sees the observation
without that hand (hands list and its inventory removed) and its commands are re-indexed
around it, so every authored route, queue and V219/V233 hand count stays the parent's. The
hire goes out only at a step where the parent hires nobody and the authored tape hires nobody
later that day, and only when today's expected carrot gain clearly beats the hire price. The
hand does one PICKUP at its spawn tile (fertilizer is bought first when the shed is short),
then leaves the shed-access tiles for the rest of the day. Everything fails closed to the
parent action.
