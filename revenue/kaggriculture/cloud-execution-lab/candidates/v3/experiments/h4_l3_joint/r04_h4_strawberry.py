"""V3.1 H4 experiment: reconcile an undersized current STRAWBERRY sale.

This is a live-R04 candidate module, not a default policy change.  The parent E184
sale window intentionally refuses to advance an item when the current action already
contains a SELL for that item.  For STRAWBERRY only, this module can reuse that
existing row as the reservation sink: it moves already-planned future strawberry
sales into the current row, bounded by current projected shed stock, and records the
same per-due-step debt that E184 subtracts later.

No new market row is created.  No sale is invented: every added unit is backed by a
future tape SELL inside E184's normal horizon and by stock already projected in the
shed this turn.  The feature is default-off and is intended for paired official-gate
measurement before any runtime/default integration.
