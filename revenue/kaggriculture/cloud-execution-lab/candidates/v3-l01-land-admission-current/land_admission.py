"""Minimal L01 land-admission mechanism for a current TITAN package.

The historical L01 arm mutated only precomputed route data.  This module keeps
that exact intervention surface: after ``TitanAgent._initialize`` has built its
route table, append one ``BUY_LAND`` market order at steps 74 and 98 wherever
the market row has capacity and does not already contain a land purchase.

No observation, seed, opponent, seat, score, or environment variable is read.
