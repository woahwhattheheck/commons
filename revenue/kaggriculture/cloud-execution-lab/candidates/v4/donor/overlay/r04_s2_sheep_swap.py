"""Parked TITAN V4 S2 candidate: bounded COW -> SHEEP substitution in wool towns.

This module is intentionally standalone and has no GitHub/ref plumbing.  It mirrors the
published V231 transaction discipline: confirm the animal purchase from the next observed
shed delta before rewriting linked PICKUP/PLACE commands, and only top up an already-existing
SELL row with production physically attributable to confirmed swapped animals.

Integration contract: call this *after* the existing V231/V233 parent action and pass the
selected native tape for same-day future-purchase conflict checks.  Ship behind an OFF key.
