"""Conservative uncared end-of-day FEED suppression for the TITAN V4 animal-service lane.

The source-bound mechanism permits one unfed EOD, but activation is stricter:
``apply_guarded_uncared_eod_feed_skip`` additionally requires a no-displacement
EOD stock certificate and an authored next-day route that carries the saved
WHEAT from the reset shed state to an effective FEED before the second EOD.

Candidate-only transform. Default-off at every integration seam.
