"""Caller-tape earlier-day frontier for the Gemini/Antigravity STARVE_SKIP seam.

The canonical FASTING helper deliberately admits FEED suppression only at hour
23, where it is source-certain that no later same-day CARE can be authored.  A
current-native census found that surface cold.  This research-only successor
asks a narrower question: if a *complete supplied remainder of the same day*
contains no later FEED or CARE at the animal, can the same source theorem be
evaluated earlier in the day?

This module never predicts a future action and never authenticates a trace.  It
shape-validates an explicit caller-supplied sequence of later observation/action
pairs through hour 23.  The existing FASTING helper remains the mechanical
eligibility authority: a synthetic hour-23 view of the same current state is used
only to reuse its animal, pending-CARE, escape, physical-WHEAT and malformed-state
guards.  A local semantic-FEED occupancy check additionally rejects a current
same-site extended FEED that the older exact-row FASTING helper could miss.

The output proves only "no blocker in this supplied tape."  It is not current-
native reachability evidence until an external replay/receipt owner binds the
current state, suffix bytes and interpreter/source identity.  Research/
counterfactual only; no runtime/default/feature key or activation claim.
