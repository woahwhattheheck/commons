"""A4: second-wave melons planted on day 12 (idea-hunt A lane).

Economics (engine-verified, pinned kaggriculture.py @ 28b6d8af3):
  MELON seed $80 -> up to 6 x $250 = $1,500 (18.75x ROI). Non-ongoing crop:
  planted with yield_units=1; each WATER inside the yield window adds +1
  (window_start = (max_yield_day+1)//2 = 6, so days P+6..P+12 for planting day P),
  capped at max_yield=6. HARVEST needs age >= first_yield_day = 10 and frees the
  tile. The plant dies at step (P+13)*24 and turns to WEED after 2 consecutive
  unwatered days (the planting day itself counts as unwatered, so the planting
  day MUST be watered).

  Planted day 12: water d12 (survival), water d13+ (survival every other day is
  enough, daily is simpler), yield accrues d18-24, harvest d22-24, tile decays
  from the start of day 25. Harvested melons ride the existing sale machinery
  (evening flush sells MELON).

Mechanism: the lane hires its own crew (hired hands reset every dawn, so the
crew is re-hired daily) and drives them with a per-worker job queue, V219-style.
Day 12 hires 2 workers (plant + water N tiles); days 13-24 hire 1 worker/day
(water; harvest d22-24 with same-day PLACE to the shed). Everything is a
post-processing layer on the v3_agent() seam: parent tape commands are never
edited, only appended to (market) or extended (extra hand commands).

Safety properties:
  * Default OFF; with enabled=False the action object is returned untouched.
  * Never exceeds MAX_MARKET_ORDERS; never appends HIRE on a step where the
    parent already queues HIRE (avoids confusing parent hire accounting).
  * PLANT only on free (None) tiles with seeds actually on hand; per-step PLANT
    demand never exceeds the seed stock (the engine voids the whole crop's
    PLANTs for the turn otherwise).
  * Money floor before buying seeds/hiring.
  * New hands are *detected* (yesterday's count vs today's), never assumed, so
    a failed HIRE degrades to a retry, not a misdirected worker.
  * Tile identity is re-derived every step from planted_day == plant_day, so the
    lane survives any parent interference on its tiles.

Known interaction: the extra hires on days 18-24 can trip V219's
len(hands) != expected guard, standing the V219 tomato investment down. Per
idea-hunt A1 that investment is -EV (~$800/game), so the direction is benign,
but it is a coupling to be aware of when gating.
