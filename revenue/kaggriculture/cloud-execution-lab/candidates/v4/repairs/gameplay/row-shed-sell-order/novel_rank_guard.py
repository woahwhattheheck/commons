"""Fail-closed final-action novelty admission for STRATUM row-shed ordering.

STRATUM is injected inside ``FrozenSelected.transform``. After that seam the
existing seller may resize, blank, append or reorder market rows before TITAN
applies canonical market pressure. Therefore neither an intermediate rank
comparison nor a direct pressure replay from the STRATUM seam proves that
STRATUM changes the action ultimately returned to the engine.

This module deliberately does not replay that stateful suffix. Its caller must
supply the two already-produced final returned actions from an authenticated,
isolated dual-arm execution of the complete canonical suffix. Admission then
requires both of these independent facts:

* the STRATUM candidate changed only a leading executable positive-quantity
  SELL block inside the official market prefix; and
* the two final returned actions still differ in engine-effective market
  semantics inside that executable prefix after all remaining seller economics
  and pressure.

Final rows are compared by the pinned official market parser/quote semantics,
not raw syntax: parser-dead rows are inert, HIRE/BUY_LAND ignore extra tokens,
positive BUY/SELL quantities use ``int(...)`` coercion, unsupported item/op
combinations are inert, and trailing inert slots are behaviorally irrelevant.
Interior inert slots are retained because row index controls lockstep timing.

Suffix-only differences never establish novelty. Missing, malformed or
non-comparable evidence fails closed to exact parent identity. This is an
evidence/admission primitive, not a controller and not a second seller/pressure
implementation.
