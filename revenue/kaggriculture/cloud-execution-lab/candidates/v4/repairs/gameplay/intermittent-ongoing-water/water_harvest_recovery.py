"""Productive successor admission for Gemini/Antigravity ALTWATER.

The original HYDRA theorem proves that some established TOMATO/STRAWBERRY plants
can survive one unwatered EOD.  The literal WATER->PASS rewrite is deliberately
*not* promoted here.  This module admits only a narrower two-day research pair:

    current eligible WATER -> HARVEST
    next day, same live plant -> exactly one WATER

HARVEST is accepted only when the current source observation proves positive
stored yield, so the reclaimed row is productive rather than a syntactic PASS.
The next-day observation must prove that the same crop survived with the expected
one-day missed-water streak and the supplied recovery action must actually WATER
that site without another same-callback actor DIGging the plant.  No forecast or
scheduler promise is treated as execution proof.

Research/candidate-only.  No runtime/default/config key is created.
