# V4 committed-seed retry executable-prefix repair

Status: **canonical current-ABI donor; not activated by this package**.

Current `cloud-committed-seed-retry/seed_retry.py::apply_committed_seed_retry()` has two raw-tape reads that are stricter than engine execution:

1. the future reserve-window `BUY_PRODUCT` veto scans every raw market row; and
2. inherited `SellScheduler.cash_reserve()` sums every raw market row.

The engine and the current `FrozenSelected` funding trace execute only `market[:maxMarketOrdersPerTurn]`. Therefore an engine-dead suffix row can falsely veto a committed seed retry or create phantom reserved spend.

`exec_prefix.py` is deliberately feature-local. It provides the configured executable prefix, a prefix-only dynamic-product veto, and a prefix-only reserve adapter that reuses the incumbent `_order_spend` state transitions. It does **not** change shared seller reserve semantics, selected/route tapes, feature defaults, or `propose_seed_retry()` appendix-only admission.

## Integration seam

Inside `apply_committed_seed_retry()` only:

- derive the configured positive `maxMarketOrdersPerTurn`;
- apply the existing hard `BUY_PRODUCT` veto only to that prefix in every represented queue;
- replace this feature's call to `runtime.consumer.cash_reserve(...)` with `prefix_cash_reserve(...)`;
- preserve all other guards and funding certification unchanged.

Coverage includes dead-vs-live suffix behavior for `BUY_PRODUCT`, `HIRE`, and `BUY_SEED`; current and future queues; non-default limits (`12` and `3`); malformed limits/tapes; non-mutation; and cross-turn dynamic-product vetoes.

No activation, default flip, production/Kaggle ref movement, shared `cash_reserve()` edit, or sibling V4 root is authorized by this receipt.
