"""V4 key: direction-conditional execution pacing (r04_exec_pace).

Microstructure lane (2026-09-11). Measured +$63/game mean over 16 hardened
gate cells (signs 14+/0-/2=; GATED-PASS, STACKED under stack-and-ship).
Ported from the v3.1 candidate tree
(`~/workspace/build/arb-v4/microstructure/tree-v31exec/`, gate `gate-exec1/`)
onto the V4 base tree as a default-OFF stacked key.

Mechanism: tracks a trailing 25-step observed-price history per drainable good
(WOOL/MILK/STRAWBERRY/MELON). When the trailing slope exceeds +$0.03/step the
good's market is momentum-rising (shop drains outpacing supply): dumping the
sale window's advanced quantity in one step walks the price down for no
reason, so per-step advanced/flush sales for that good are capped at
drain-absorbing levels (WOOL 3, MILK 3, STRAWBERRY 4, MELON 6), spreading the
same units across drain ticks to harvest the recovery between chunks. When the
market is flat/falling the window keeps its dump-early behavior (optimal in
glut regimes). Direction-conditional, so it is safe in both regimes.

The caps are applied inside reserve_sales() BEFORE debt recording: un-advanced
units simply stay planned at their tape steps -- leak-free by construction (no
E1-style debt leak; E1 capped rows after debts were booked, which
debt-cancelled the remainder into the terminal liquidation). The evening flush
applies the same caps. Pacing stops at END_STEP (690) so the endgame flush
finishes unimpeded.

The enable flag lives in r04_full_router (R04_EXEC_PACE, set by
install(exec_pace=...)); this module carries only observation state, the slope
test, and the caps. When the flag is off the router's seam short-circuits
before calling cap_for(); note_prices() only records history -- the action
path is byte-identical to the unkeyed route.

State is per-game: a step <= the last recorded step (new game in a reused
worker process) resets the histories first, fixing the cross-game state leak
that caused a catastrophic failure in the drain-candidate gate. Every entry
point fails closed and never raises. Python standard library only.
