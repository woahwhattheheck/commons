"""Conservative MELON production cap for the recovered R04 lane.

The original Antigravity carrier counted only MELON already sold. That is not
sufficient to cap lifetime production: held MELON and live MELON plantings are
already committed supply too. This source therefore reserves all three before
admitting any new MELON proposal.

FourthQuadrant proposals are mutually exclusive alternatives. Their executable
work lives in ``proposal['variants'][route_id]['patches']`` and each harvested
bundle lot binds the planted tile, plant step, and 1-based worker slot back to
that program. Outer ``tiles`` and ``seed_units`` are metadata only. MELON
alternatives are therefore admitted whole and unchanged only after every route
variant authenticates the same executable MELON PLANT set. An oversized or
malformed MELON alternative is dropped; inspecting one alternative never spends
budget for another.

The default cap remains 28 units as a deliberately conservative policy knob;
it is *not* claimed to equal exact full-season town consumption. Official
engine town-center consumption is handled only by the sold-count fallback.

Default OFF. The runtime must not call this module unless the existing
``r04_melon_cap`` flag is exactly ``True``.
