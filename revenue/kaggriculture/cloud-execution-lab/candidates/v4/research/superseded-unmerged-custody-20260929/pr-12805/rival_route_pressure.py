"""Public rival-production pressure evidence for inherited TITAN route branches.

Research-only.  This module does not select a route, mutate an action, inspect
private rival state, predict hidden episode RNG, or claim economic dominance.
It answers a narrower question: when one already-authored route tail requests
more future SELL units than another, what *publicly visible* rival standing
production and already-unlocked town demand coexist with that incremental load?

The output is designed as an admission/falsification input for the one existing
V4 route selector, not as a second controller.
