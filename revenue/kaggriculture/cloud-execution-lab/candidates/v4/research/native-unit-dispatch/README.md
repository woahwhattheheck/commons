# KINETIC: native unit-dispatch fusion — research-only

**Disposition: no measured whole-native speed gain; do not promote or add a required wiring task.**

This closes ASTRA-KINETIC's broad unit-action execution-cost investigation in the
single canonical `main:candidates/v4` workspace. It is neither another V4 runtime
nor a gameplay policy. Source, runnable checks, actual execution results and a
repeatable negative promotion result are delivered together.

## What was built

`compose_kinetic.py` generates a scratch derivative of the native mechanics
module. It inlines the three tiny actor-position/inventory/position-set helpers
inside `_apply_unit_action`, while keeping identity-guarded fallbacks for rebound
helpers. It preserves the inventory-growth side effect of PASS, missing-actor
short-circuit order, negative indices, position replacement rather than alias
mutation, mapping access order, live movement-table edits, and every remaining
action branch. No mutable world state is cached. The list-construction shortcut
also checks the original list binding.

The composer authenticates exact function/dependency spans, rejects drift and
name collisions, is idempotent, and preserves every source byte outside its
alias block and the single target function. Input files cannot be overwritten
through its CLI. This is an Apache-2.0 derivative of the original pinned Kaggle
helper, not a claim that the generated function remains unmodified upstream.

## Executed evidence

Python 3.13.5; normal and `-O` component runs each pass **15/15** tests with no
failures, errors or skips. Each mode covers 1,172 direct differential pairs
(including 208 expected exception pairs) and 188 full official-interpreter
pairs: 184 completed transition pairs plus four expected numeric-conversion
exception pairs. Nine additional initializations occur per suite. Animal PLACE
with an ignored nonfinite third field is a positive control, not classified as
a conversion exception. Both seats and EOD/terminal boundaries are included.

Ten deliberately broken variants are rejected by named behavioral assertions
in each mode, never credited for infrastructure errors. A clean nine-test
control runs before the variants. Full interpreter tests retain the engine's
atomic PLANT admission, including ghost rows; this component does not replace
UNITFLOW's separate joint-stage repair.

Twenty complete native `main.py::agent` games were executed: eight uninstrumented
normal, eight uninstrumented optimized, and four separately instrumented games.
All 14,380 native callbacks completed; all ten baseline/candidate pairs match
complete returned-action and post-interpreter state-stream hashes, final scores
and termination. The 16 uninstrumented games use seeds 17/101 and both seats
against the official starter, with alternating arm order (reversed in the
optimized panel). Four instrumented seed17 games independently show 310,798
unit-kernel calls per game, with identical opcode histograms in both arms.

All 109 runtime members and the exact SOURCE manifest were authenticated.
The game fixture is the checked b567 archive, not the subsequently assembled
whole-V4 tree. The live mechanics source matched this input when inspected.
No claims are made about competitive opponents or hosted Kaggle performance.

## Why this is not promoted

Seven alternating 150,000-call local batches per fixture measured about 5.05%
less elapsed for PASS, 6.58% for movement and 3.94% for the constructed mixed
loop. These small helper-level gains did **not** establish an end-to-end gain:
median paired native elapsed ratios were 1.00249 normal and 1.00996 optimized
(candidate/baseline). Individual signs were mixed. This is a noisy neutral
result, not proof of a statistically significant slowdown either.

Preserve the source and tests as research. Do not multiply the microbenchmark
with WEAVE/PORTAGE/PHENOLOGY timings or force this into their active stack.
Their methods remain separate; no combined-stack execution is claimed here.
In-place function `__code__` mutation, arbitrary concurrent monkeypatch races,
forced-deadline cancellation and Python 3.11 were not validated. Helper rebinding
and ordinary mutable input/alias behavior are explicitly tested.

## Reproduce offline

Use an extracted immutable copy of `exports/titan-current.tar.gz` with SHA256
`b567942e4fb4e0571ebf9f8eaaf143d4a9156df3289f09a98db37823ef4d68d9`.
Set `B` to that extracted directory and run from this research directory.

Before starting any `run_kinetic_games.py` parent process, obtain the runner Git
blob from an **external exact-head authority** (for example the GitHub contents
or tree entry for the commit being tested) and independently confirm the
checkout file matches it. Do not create the expected value by hashing the same
mutable file and then treating that self-derived value as provenance. For this
reviewed runner, `RUNNER_BLOB=ea4686bea9ea1427358f59498430ff05e6b06390`.

```

The external runner pin closes the trusted-parent/post-launch repository-reopen
boundary. It does not claim that Python can authenticate its own initial source
before that source begins executing; the launcher/executor must perform the
pre-invocation exact-head check above. After the parent captures and authenticates
its control bundle, child processes do **not** execute a materialized runner
pathname. The parent feeds the captured runner bytes to a constant `python -c`
bootstrap over stdin; that bootstrap recomputes the Git blob against the external
pin before compile/exec, and child-only modes require the injected attested
identity. Replacing either the repository runner or a scratch-path decoy after
capture therefore cannot change child source execution.

The game runner changes only mechanics in a temporary runtime copy, starts a
fresh process per game from captured control bytes, preserves all raw market and
unit rows, records full stream hashes and per-call timing, and rejects incomplete
games or mismatched traces. The committed historical receipt normalizes repeated
identities while retaining all 20 game outcomes and aggregate timing, all 42
benchmark timing samples, both test receipts, and every fault-control result. It
does not contain every per-call sample; those are regenerated in the runner's
output. Historical evidence predating the custody hardening remains historical;
new custody claims require an exact-head gate.

No production source, config, release archive, workflow definition or Kaggle
submission is changed. This completed research lane creates no production wiring
requirement; exact-head evidence gates for custody changes remain separate.
