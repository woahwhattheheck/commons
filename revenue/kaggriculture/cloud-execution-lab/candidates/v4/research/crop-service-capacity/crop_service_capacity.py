"""Source-derived crop service capacity bounds for TITAN V4.

This module deliberately does not choose crops, schedule movement, predict market
fills, or mutate returned actions. It exposes conservative action-budget ceilings
that a planner may consume before expanding its crop footprint.

The official engine creates every plant with ``consecutive_unwatered == 1``.
At end of day an unwatered plant increments that counter and becomes a weed at
``>= 2``. Therefore establishing one new plant that still exists after the same
end-of-day boundary requires at least two unit actions before that boundary:
one PLANT and one WATER.

The bounds are intentionally envelopes, not feasibility proofs. In particular,
future BUY_LAND / DIG / HARVEST can increase the set of plantable cells, so
*current* empty owned tiles are telemetry only and must not cap an impossibility
bound. The observation-authoritative board cell count is a safe physical upper
bound for simultaneous surviving new plants; ignoring the extra actions/cash
needed to make those cells plantable only overestimates capacity.
