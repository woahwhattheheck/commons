"""Kaggriculture agent — v11: livestock economy.

WHY THIS IS A REWRITE, NOT A TUNE
=================================
Reading the #1-vs-#2 replay (episode 90303687, 135k and 151k against our 57k)
and tracing market inventory exposed the actual structure of the game.

Market inventory starts at I0 = 10,000 per product. Town shops CONSUME product
every few turns, draining inventory; players selling ADD to it. Price rises as
inventory falls. So the question for any product is whether town demand outruns
player supply. Over a full leaders' game:

    WHEAT       inventory -860   price  25 -> 54
    STRAWBERRY  inventory  -35   price 120 -> 170  (peaked 248)
    EGG         inventory -318   price  50 -> 69
    MILK        inventory    ~0  price 160 -> 158  (peaked 217)
    WOOL        inventory    0   price 200 -> 200
    MELON       inventory +144   price 250 -> 43
    FERTILIZER  inventory +353   price 100 -> 29

Only melon and fertilizer collapse — and they are exactly the two products no
shop demands. Checking the shop table: wheat is wanted by 5 shops, strawberry
by 4, milk by 3, eggs by 2, wool by 1 at double rate. Melon appears in none of
them, so its only sink is the town centre; fertilizer has no sink at all.

Our v9 economy was 17 melon tiles plus goose fertilizer — i.e. built entirely
on the two dead products. Their prices crashed *because we produced them*.

The livestock economy instead:
  * COW   $400, milk every 2 days, base 160, 3 shops demand it
  * SHEEP $500, wool every 3 days, base 200, yarn store demands 2x
  * GOOSE $300, egg every day,     base  50, 2 shops demand it

CARE matters here in a way it never did for a melon farm. It banks +1 yield per
fed-and-cared day and pays out on the next scheduled production, so a cow fed
and cared daily yields 3 milk per 2 days rather than 1. That is ~$270/day on a
$400 animal. v9 measured CARE as a loss only because its actions competed with
melon watering; with livestock as the economy, CARE *is* the economy.
