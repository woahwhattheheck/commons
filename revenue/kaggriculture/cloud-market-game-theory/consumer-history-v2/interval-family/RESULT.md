# Complete bounded interval-family result

## Outcome

The source-bound scan reproduced all **64/64** committed `consumer-history-v2` terminal families with the exact frozen source before applying the current shared-capacity refinement and interval-family consumer.

The new consumer passed **12/12** focused methods. It enumerates every feasible integer vector under one shared shed-capacity bound and explicit slot/operating-stock hypotheses, or returns no scenarios with a named limit. Marginal endpoints are never combined independently.

## Retained-bank result

- Original exact-history status: **40 ready / 24 insufficient joint history**.
- Every record has all five same-phase interval windows after shared-capacity tightening.
- Complete interval enumeration is ready for **28** records; all 28 were already exact-history ready.
- **36** records exceed the 32-vector budget and return `interval_vector_limit` with no partial scenarios.
- All **24** exact-history-incomplete records hit that limit: 10 at the first lag and 14 at the second lag.
- Another 12 already-ready records exceed the limit only when extra censored lags are added; their existing exact family remains the preferred complete family.
- For all 40 exact-history-ready records, restricting the interval consumer to the exact historical lags reproduces the same economic `shed` and `market` scenario inputs.
- Newly ready records: **0**.
- Terminal-input or selector executions required: **0**.

This is a usable fail-closed mechanism and a measured explanation of the remaining coverage boundary. It does not support a policy/default change or a larger scenario budget by itself.
