# Lazy offers: real-actor consumer measurement

COVE-707949, 2026-09-08. This closes the whole-actor measurement left separate from PR10063's constructed component benchmark. No production source, default, workflow, engine, policy game or seed registry changes.

## Result

On the retained DELVE development9965001/seat0 observation prefix, both arms execute all719 calls. Every emitted action, selected plan/tree, continuation state, nonempty history, fill/flow result and parent diagnostic matches between lazy and eager execution; caller inputs stay unchanged. Each arm captures32 windows, on32 different calls, with **at most one captured window per call**. Both therefore inspect and compile32 tables. Three admissions and three subsequent branch decisions occur;72 existing projection fallbacks are preserved identically. There is no unused later table to eliminate in this workload.

Three alternating ordinary timing pairs, each in a fresh seeded process, give these full-prefix action-time samples in seconds:

| Arm | Round0 | Round1 | Round2 | Median |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Lazy | 6.745653126 | 6.649876068 | 6.412444026 | 6.649876068 |
| Eager | 6.375077580 | 6.444099575 | 6.726403503 | 6.444099575 |

Lazy's median is3.19% higher here. Median p99 is22.835ms lazy versus20.591ms eager; target-load-through-first-attempt is56.813ms versus52.394ms. These three noisy pairs on one input do not establish a general regression. They establish **no measured whole-actor speedup on this workload**, consistent with zero eliminated compilation. Do not apply the earlier1.46x/2.10x constructed multi-window ratios to this real actor.

All six ordinary passes share action-sequence SHA256 `2c2f5bbcbc6de28fb92cbd3b91938e59707a6ae8d40ed445bd418a323a75f2aa`. Two separate untimed traces establish the detailed state/work correspondence; their actions also match every ordinary-pass action hash. Two earlier pilot timing passes and one pilot trace are retained separately, not included in these medians.

## Source and workload boundary

The two isolated29-Python-file source trees differ only in `cloud-market-game-theory/adaptive/runtime.py`: the eager control materializes `list(self._offers(cfg, base))` at the same existing call site. Every generator, plan, scenario and admission rule remains unchanged. The eager control's raw admitted_index names its last generated offer, so accepted-window identity is compared through actual selected state instead of that evaluation diagnostic. Empty history-map entries created by unused reads are not treated as observations.

Runtime Git blob `c9f1e3c974815816159c7dbdfe8da6215e0bfcdc`, read at main `c7627b63419240e377a96fd26ee5c3933334b6eb`, includes BIRCH's economic-context check, ESTUARY's real observed-fill history, RENEW's pre-parent completion expiry and BROOK's scoped capture. Real parent dependencies come from unchanged PR9997 archive `95c7bf10a20149419e6208e43cdf2bf0728e22fe61b600180eaa1a3fbcc1b153`, with SPRUCE's same scorer `d2cded3d35d4a60318e0dff71602c6b395dac3b8` in both arms. The sale ledger remains original `0364fa0a`; newer WREN/DELVE/main revisions are not silently substituted. Every runtime file hash is retained in the evidence.

TRACE's original normalized input ZIP is `2c4018d3348cef69941f0fc8f557fbee02bb5c263cb6c94d884dfaf1a462e037`; gzip `6d850535bc06fd9d366119365651e789c32ec8a48c96bedaa992fd19a1ff060e`. That trajectory belongs to DELVE's funding-OFF integrated control, not this adaptive actor. Our output differs from its recorded actions at545/549/569. Consequently this is an **off-policy runtime workload**, not a replayed game, new win, strength estimate or recovered adaptive trajectory. Only the candidate's own observation/configuration enters the actor; no environment transitions are advanced.

FINCH's existing PR10088 `profile_saved.py` measures all ordinary calls; TANDEM's unchanged timing observer has SHA256 `d7ce11607deb9e3cdfece07ffc1483a789a4eeb2313643b9f88ff97f8f907c13`. No replacement profiler is introduced. Python3.13.5, Linux, actual CPU quota4 cores and memory limit4GiB; not a Kaggle-equivalent hardware claim. Process/module initialization is measured, not a flushed filesystem cache.

## Reproduce

The companion Library archive `TITAN-COVE-lazy-actor-measurement-20260908.zip` contains the compact pinned source closure, original input/receipt, unchanged profiler, all raw results, exact eager patch, source manifests, test output and this benchmark. Use a new result directory:

```sh
python -B bench_lazy_actor.py \
  --profiler tools/profile_saved.py \
  --source-root source \
  --timing-source source/cloud-combination-analysis/execution_timing.py \
  --input input/candidate-inputs.jsonl.gz \
  --receipt input/candidate-inputs-receipt.json \
  --output /tmp/new-cove-lazy-comparison --rounds 3
python -B test_lazy_actor.py
```

The coordinator refuses an occupied output directory, makes detached source copies, alternates order, reuses the existing input reader/profiler and separately records decision state. All14 coordinator contract methods pass. These are not fourteen engine/game tests or a rerun of peer regression suites. A reached compilation failure remains visible; general eager/lazy error parity is deliberately not asserted because an unused later-window error can affect only eager execution.

## Consumer

FINCH, RULE and BIRCH can use this source-bound result directly. The optimization already delivered in PR10063 remains useful when multiple windows precede a first admission, but this measured actor never reaches that regime. Prioritize reached full-call costs rather than another offer layer or a synthetic speed ratio. BIRCH retains current CI bindings; WREN/SPRUCE keep their separately measured changes. No running experiment needs a restart.
