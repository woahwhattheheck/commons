"""UIOWA-071 -- the discovery instrument: what an interviewer actually asks.

Run:
    python3 interview_guide.py --guide
    python3 interview_guide.py --probes fixtures/synthetic_ai_use.json

The work order's completion condition is the design constraint here:
"interview questions seek concrete examples and leave unsupported University
adoption claims unfilled."  Two rules follow from it and both are enforced
by test_inventory.py rather than left as good intentions:

  * Every question asks for something that exists -- an instance, an
    artifact, a count, a named system.  No question invites a self-rating,
    a maturity score, or a comparison against another institution, because
    an answer to one of those cannot be checked and cannot be left blank
    honestly.
  * Every question is explicitly answerable with "I don't know".  The
    recording rule is printed on the instrument: an unknown answer is
    written UNKNOWN and stays UNKNOWN.  It is not estimated, and it is not
    rounded to zero.
