# Opportunity Deadline Command Center

The Opportunity Deadline Command Center is an offline operating surface for a portfolio of evidence-bound RFPs, RFIs, market engagements, registrations, conferences, and similar paid-opportunity deadlines.

It answers a narrow question: **given exact source evidence and a trusted evaluation time, what deserves owner attention next?** It does not qualify a bidder, infer buyer intent, contact a buyer, register for anything, submit anything, price work, sign a contract, spend money, or recognize revenue.

## Why this exists

Buyer-specific qualification packets answer whether an individual opportunity is supportable. A growing portfolio has a different failure mode: controlling dates, source freshness, missing packet/addendum work, and ownership become scattered across threads. This module creates one deterministic cross-opportunity queue without replacing buyer-specific qualification.

A deadline can drive an owner-review state only when it is bound to an `OFFICIAL` source. A date learned from a `SECONDARY` source stays discovery evidence and forces source recovery rather than creating action authority.

## Input contract

The input is strict JSON:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "opportunity-deadline-command-input/v1",
  "opportunities": [
    {
      "opportunity_id": "nhdes-2026-093",
      "buyer": "Example Public Buyer",
      "solicitation_id": "RFP-2026-093",
      "title": "Example systems procurement",
      "owner_ref": "OWNER-REF",
      "route_state": "TEAMING",
      "source_set_complete": true,
      "controlling_source_id": "official-notice-v1",
      "packet_state": "COMPLETE",
      "sources": [
        {
          "source_id": "official-notice-v1",
          "authority": "OFFICIAL",
          "captured_at": "2026-09-13T10:00:00Z",
          "sha256": "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa",
          "url": "https://buyer.example.gov/rfp",
          "label": "Official solicitation notice",
          "generation": 1
        }
      ],
      "deadlines": [
        {
          "deadline_id": "question-v1",
          "kind": "QUESTION",
          "at": "2026-09-24T18:00:00Z",
          "source_id": "official-notice-v1",
          "generation": 1
        },
        {
          "deadline_id": "response-v1",
          "kind": "RESPONSE",
          "at": "2026-10-08T21:00:00Z",
          "source_id": "official-notice-v1",
          "generation": 1
        }
      ],
      "blocker_codes": [],
      "owner_action_refs": ["OWNER-REVIEW"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Supported route states are `PRIME`, `TEAMING`, `PARTNER_REQUIRED`, `HOLD`, `NO_BID`, and `UNKNOWN`. Supported deadline kinds are `QUESTION`, `CONFERENCE`, `RESPONSE`, `MARKET_ENGAGEMENT`, `REGISTRATION`, and `ADDENDA_CHECK`.

A deadline extension is a new deadline generation with a new ID and `supersedes_deadline_id`. Silent mutation of a deadline ID is never accepted. An effective `QUESTION`, `REGISTRATION`, or `ADDENDA_CHECK` date may not fall after the effective response/market-engagement deadline.

## Policy

Policy is also strict JSON:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "opportunity-deadline-command-policy/v1",
  "max_source_age_minutes": 10080,
  "critical_window_minutes": 1440,
  "high_window_minutes": 10080,
  "addenda_review_window_minutes": 20160
}
```

The policy is SHA-bound into every result. `critical_window_minutes` must be less than or equal to `high_window_minutes`.

## Operating states

Each opportunity receives exactly one conservative state:

- `SOURCE_RECOVERY_REQUIRED` — official authority is missing, stale, incomplete, or a declared deadline is secondary-only.
- `ADDENDA_REVIEW_REQUIRED` — a bound addenda check is due or addenda remain unchecked near a live response deadline.
- `QUESTION_WINDOW_OPEN` — the next official deadline is a question cutoff.
- `CONFERENCE_ACTION_REVIEW` — the next official deadline is a conference milestone.
- `REGISTRATION_ACTION_REVIEW` — the next official deadline is a registration cutoff.
- `RESPONSE_DUE_SOON` — the next official response/market-engagement deadline is inside the critical window.
- `RESPONSE_WINDOW_OPEN` — a verified official response/market-engagement deadline is live outside the critical window.
- `NOT_YET_OPEN` — the next official deadline carries a future `opens_at`.
- `EXPIRED` — no declared future deadline remains.
- `TERMINAL_NO_BID` — owner route state is explicitly `NO_BID`.
- `HOLD` — route evidence itself is `HOLD` or `UNKNOWN`.

Priority is transparent (`CRITICAL`, `HIGH`, `NORMAL`, `TERMINAL`, `HOLD`) and derived only from state plus policy windows. There is no model score, expected value, win probability, budget inference, or revenue estimate.

## Output integrity

`compile_portfolio()` emits canonical JSON containing:

- input, policy, row, and receipt SHA-256 digests;
- state/priority counts;
- deterministic queue ordering;
- privacy-minimized source/deadline bindings;
- an explicit authority map with every external-action permission false.

`markdown_projection()` and `ics_projection()` are deterministic projections of that result. ICS contains only `OFFICIAL` effective deadlines, no attendees/organizers, and a description that repeats the owner-review-only authority ceiling.

`verify_result()` first reproduces the exact original result from the original inputs/policy/evaluation time, then recompiles against a separately supplied trusted current time. It fails if the current state/priority/controlling deadline has changed. Mere minute-count drift does not invalidate a result until it crosses an operating or priority boundary.

## CLI

The production CLI does **not** accept a caller-selected current time. It samples UTC internally.

```bash
python -m revenue.opportunity_deadline_command.engine compile \
  --input opportunities.json \
  --policy policy.json \
  --json-out command.json \
  --markdown-out command.md \
  --ics-out command.ics

python -m revenue.opportunity_deadline_command.engine verify \
  --input opportunities.json \
  --policy policy.json \
  --result command.json
```

Inputs are bounded ordinary UTF-8 files. Output publication is create-exclusive and refuses overwrite/final-component symlink following. The module makes no network calls.

## Authority ceiling

Every state, queue row, Markdown line, and calendar event is **owner-review decision support only**. Nothing here authorizes buyer/partner/sponsor contact, portal login/registration, question submission, conference registration, proposal/RFI/bid submission, signature/certification, pricing/staffing commitment, contract acceptance, spend, payment/provider mutation, award assertion, cash assertion, or revenue recognition.
