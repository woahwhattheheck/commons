# Posted paid work and procurement discovery, 2026-09-05

Three headless Claude runs on the owner PC, driven through the C1 runner (`integrations/claude_headless/claude_headless.py`), each told to find currently open, publicly posted opportunities, fetch every kept posting to confirm it is open, and write one table with an evidence URL per row plus a "Not verified" section. Tools were limited to WebSearch, WebFetch, Write and Read; MCP servers were disabled with `--strict-mcp`; nobody was contacted and nothing was sent. The tables are the children's verbatim output. A row is a lead to check, not a qualified buyer.

| Lane | File | Table rows | Session | Final run | Model | Turns | Cost | Wall |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Open RFPs: LIMS / water-quality lab data management (AquaTrace fit) | [lims.md](lims.md) | 3 | `09d878c9…` | `29a84045213d4815` | claude-fable-5 | 145 | $13.82 | 1350.7 s |
| Open solicitations: small-business websites / local SEO (finished-site offer) | [sites.md](sites.md) | 8 | `03fed25d…` | `9be1783ba2824b11` | claude-fable-5 | 138 | $14.52 | 1430.9 s |
| Posted paid work: AI-agent / MCP / Claude integration (diagnostic → proof) | [ai_agent_work.md](ai_agent_work.md) | 13 | `97da070d…` | `7bc00fd86ed64b64` | claude-fable-5 | 47 | $3.53 | 423.7 s |

## Provenance and honesty notes

- The first attempt of each lane (run ids in `provenance.json`) was denied every web call because `--tools` restricts without granting and print mode cannot prompt; each child refused to fabricate and wrote nothing. The lanes were resumed on the same sessions with `--allowed-tools WebSearch,WebFetch,Write,Read --strict-mcp`.
- Due dates and values are as the fetched page stated them at fetch time; re-check before acting.
- Fit scores are the child's judgment against the offers named in the prompt (AquaTrace LIMS; $1,500–$4,000 finished sites; $199 diagnostic → $2,500 proof). They are not underwriting.
- Raw stream-json for every run is on the owner PC under `~/.claude/commons_headless/runs/<run_id>/`.

## Rerun

```

  --permission-mode acceptEdits --allowed-tools WebSearch,WebFetch,Write,Read,Glob,Grep --strict-mcp \
  --label discovery-<lane> --peer <you> --stdin-prompt
```

## Addendum 2026-09-05 02:05Z: browser pass on the "Not verified" items

TENON opened the sources the children could not fetch in the owner PC's in-app browser (public
pages only, no login, no bot-check bypass). Results:

| Source (from the "Not verified" lists) | Browser result |
| --- | --- |
| Michigan Municipal League classifieds, RFP category (`classifieds.mml.org/jobs/function/RFP/`) | Loads after the Cloudflare interstitial. The RFP category holds **0 postings**; the 78 listings on the board are jobs, none an RFP. No Michigan small-city website RFP there this week. |
| League of Wisconsin Municipalities RFP postings (`lwm-info.org`) | Loads. **7 open RFPs, none for a website**: Kenosha Public Library strategic planning (closes Sep 7), Beloit Townline Ave reconstruction (Sep 10), Berlin aquatic center (Sep 14), Whitewater business park (Oct 2), Berlin zoning services (Sep 21), Deerfield garbage collection (Sep 11), plus one police job. |
| BidNet: Southwest Alabama Workforce Development Council, logo + website redesign | **Closed 04/29/2025** (published 04/08/2025). Drop. |
| BidNet: Maryland Dept. of State Police LIMS | **Closed 04/11/2025**; forensic evidence LIMS, not a water lab. Drop. |
| Bid Banana: Metropolitan Library System website redesign | Cloudflare bot check did not clear in this browser. Still not verified. |
| Upwork job search | Cloudflare bot check. Still not verified; needs a logged-in human browser. |

Net: no new rows; four items resolved (two closed, two boards empty of website RFPs), two remain
behind bot checks. The login-walled Connecticut / California / Minnesota bid networks, DemandStar
(North Lauderdale due date) and the paywalled rfpmart website RFPs were not attempted: they need
an account or a purchase, which is a person's call.
