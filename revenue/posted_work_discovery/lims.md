# Open LIMS / lab-software solicitations (US & Canada) — verified 2026-09-05

After ~65 web searches and ~45 page fetches, exactly **three** currently open solicitations met all criteria (LIMS/lab-software scope, US/Canada public buyer, fetched page confirms open, due date on or after 2026-09-15). Two more were fetch-verified open but miss the date cutoff: **City of Billings, MT — Laboratory Information Management System (due Sep 5, 2026)** and **Ohio Department of Health — Whole Genome LIMS (due Sep 10, 2026)**. Most other LIMS solicitations found (OCWD, Montgomery County MD, Houston Health Dept., Abilene TX, MWD Salt Lake & Sandy, U. of Iowa, Kansas DOA, Bureau of Reclamation, MD OCME, Four Rivers, Padre Dam, Olmsted County, Clean Water Services) were fetch-verified as already closed or awarded. A grep of the full CanadaBuys open-tender CSV (fetched 2026-09-05) found no open Canadian federal LIMS/lab-data tender.

Released Aug 3, 2026. | September 17, 2026 (as stated on fetched page) | https://starbridge.ai/rfp/laboratory-information-management-system-lims-replacement | Not stated on posting | 5 — drinking-water/wastewater utility LIMS replacement, the core scenario requested | Register on Loudoun Water's Bonfire portal (loudounwater.bonfirehub.com) to download documents; portal is JavaScript-only so the listing could not be fetched directly, but the opportunity was confirmed open on the evidence page. |

## Not verified

Found but could not be confirmed by fetching (blocked, JS-only, or no due date obtainable) — status unknown, do not rely on these without checking:

- **Maryland Dept. of State Police — LIMS** — listed under "open bids" on BidNet Direct (https://www.bidnetdirect.com/maryland/solicitations/open-bids/statewide/LABORATORY-INFORMATION-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM-LIMS/443438440063); bidnetdirect.com returns HTTP 403 to fetches, so open status and due date unconfirmed.
- **U.S. Customs & Border Protection — COTS forensic LIMS** (evidence entry/routing, chain-of-custody tracking) — BidNet Direct abstract (https://www.bidnetdirect.com/public/supplier/solicitations/statewide/2541439752/abstract); 403 on fetch, status unconfirmed; federal/forensic rather than water-lab focus.
- **Michigan MDHHS — Newborn Screening COTS LIMS RFP** — referenced in Starbridge search results; no fetchable page with a due date was found (Michigan SIGMA portal requires login).
- **DemandStar bid #432383 — "Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS)"** (https://www.demandstar.com/app/limited/bids/432383/details) — page is JavaScript-rendered; buyer and dates could not be extracted.
- **TechBids listing #7465 — "Laboratory Information Management System RFP (Updated)"** (https://techbids.com/bids/7465/) — returned HTTP 404 on fetch.
- **New York State Contract Reporter — "laboratory information management system (lims)" ad** (nyscr.ny.gov) — returned 404/login-required on fetch.
- Primary-source portals for the three table rows (Rocky Mountain E-Purchasing for Englewood, Bonfire for Loudoun Water, PlanetBids for San Diego) could not be fetched directly (403/JS); the three rows are verified via the fetched Starbridge listing pages shown in the Evidence URL column, each of which stated open status and the due date on 2026-09-05.
