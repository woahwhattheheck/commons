This isolated carrier turns a live human teaming conversation into something a prospective prime can evaluate and buy. It is not a University submission and it does not claim Clark's Consulting has committed to prime.

## Commercial position

The proposed TJLabs subcontract workshare is **$24,000 fixed** for bounded technical production across a six-to-eight-week assessment, with **$4,000 optional final-readout support** if separately authorized.

| Milestone | Share | Amount |
|---|---:|---:|
| Written authorization / kickoff | 40% | $9,600 |
| Draft technical work package | 40% | $9,600 |
| Accepted final technical work package | 20% | $4,800 |

Travel is excluded. Any travel requires separate written authorization. No contract, award, buyer acceptance, invoice, payment, cash, or recognized revenue is represented by this repository.

## Evidence authority: three deliberately separate things

Version 2 removes maturity, confidence, claim text, observation time, and evidence digests from the candidate packet. The boundary now has three parts:

1. **Candidate packet** — commercial engagement terms, one authority-generation identifier, and the exact set of source IDs requested for compilation. It cannot supply a score or claim.
2. **Evidence-authority bundle** — canonical source records binding solicitation, prospective prime, authority generation, AIS group, dimension, source identity/kind/reference, exact source-content SHA-256, observation time, claim, maturity, and confidence.
3. **Expected authority root** — SHA-256 of the complete normalized authority bundle, retained independently by the trusted integration host and supplied out of band to `compile_current()` or `verify_current()`.

The module checks that the expected root matches. It cannot authenticate how a caller obtained that root. A caller who controls both the authority bytes and the “expected” root has established only self-consistency, not independent provenance.

Candidate and authority source universes must match exactly. Shrinkage, expansion, duplicate IDs, generation drift, prime/solicitation drift, record mutation, source transplant, future observations, stale sources, and conflicting rooted maturity evidence fail closed.

## Current versus historical truth

`compile_current(candidate, authority, trusted_root)` samples process UTC inside the trusted-host function. There is no caller clock argument. A current report can carry `READY_FOR_PRIME_TEAMING_REVIEW` only when:

- the complete authority bundle matches the independently retained root;
- all 12 cells have rooted source records;
- no cell has conflicting rooted maturity;
- every source is at most 120 days old at verifier-owned UTC.

`verify_current(report, trusted_root)` first semantically recompiles the original packet, then re-evaluates the embedded candidate and authority at verifier-owned process UTC. A historically valid READY report can therefore become a current HOLD when evidence expires.

`compile_historical(..., evaluated_at=...)` is deterministic but emits only `HISTORICAL_*_NON_CURRENT` states. Historical replay cannot be promoted to current authority.

## Public CLI is intentionally non-authorizing

The CLI has no trusted-root input and no clock input. `compile` produces `UNTRUSTED_INSPECTION`; even twelve internally consistent cells become `UNTRUSTED_EVIDENCE_CONSISTENT` with no maturity/confidence and aggregate `HOLD_TRUSTED_AUTHORITY_REQUIRED`. `verify` proves receipt plus semantic integrity only and prints `UNTRUSTED_INTEGRITY_ONLY`.

```bash
cd revenue/uiowa_rfq_18649_workshare
python compiler.py compile \
  fixtures/synthetic_packet.json \
  fixtures/synthetic_authority.json \
  /tmp/uiowa-report.json
python compiler.py verify /tmp/uiowa-report.json
python compiler.py render /tmp/uiowa-report.json /tmp/uiowa-report.md
python -m unittest -v test_compiler.py
python -O -m unittest -v test_compiler.py
```

A trusted integration imports the module and obtains the expected root from host-controlled configuration, a signed deployment record, or another channel independent of the candidate and authority payloads:

```python
candidate = compiler.loads_strict(candidate_text)
authority = compiler.loads_strict(authority_text)
trusted_root = host_configuration.uiowa_authority_root  # not payload-derived
report = compiler.compile_current(candidate, authority, trusted_root)
verification = compiler.verify_current(report, trusted_root)
```

Do not replace `host_configuration.uiowa_authority_root` with `compiler.authority_root_sha256(authority)` at the same trust boundary; that would deliberately collapse independent authority back into self-authentication.

## Synthetic proof

The deidentified fixture intentionally yields, at frozen trusted time `2026-09-13T15:00:00Z`:

- `READY`: 9
- `HOLD_MISSING_EVIDENCE`: 1
- `HOLD_CONFLICT`: 1
- `HOLD_STALE_EVIDENCE`: 1

The public CLI maps the nine otherwise-ready cells to `UNTRUSTED_EVIDENCE_CONSISTENT` and still holds the packet for a trusted root. A held or untrusted cell never carries maturity or confidence.

The hostile suite also proves that a fully fabricated 12-cell packet cannot READY through the public path; coupled claim/score/confidence/content-digest mutation fails under the retained root; source-universe drift and cross-scope transplant fail; current READY expires; recomputed-checksum report forgery fails semantic recompile; and normal/optimized interpreters agree.

## Filesystem custody

Input files use one-descriptor, no-follow, bounded regular-file reads with pre/post inode-generation fingerprints. Same-inode mutation and pathname replacement during read fail closed.

Output publication walks every parent component with descriptor-relative no-follow opens, creates the final file exclusively, verifies the visible inode and parent generations, and never pathname-deletes after creation. If an adversary replaces the output path, the foreign replacement is reported and left untouched.

The compiler is offline and performs no provider/network writes.

## Prime and authority ceiling

TJLabs can own the evidence register, deterministic 12-cell matrix, draft finding/roadmap production support, and reproducibility/currentness receipts. The prospective prime retains the University relationship, bidder communications, submission, references, insurance, contracting, professional judgment, benchmarking conclusions, final recommendations, staffing/onsite promises, travel authority, and final readout.

All external authority flags remain false: no buyer contact, University submission, teaming signature, contract/award acceptance, travel/spend, invoice/payment request, payment/cash claim, or revenue recognition.

## Public solicitation context

The original carrier was built around public procurement descriptions of University of Iowa solicitation 18649 as a six-to-eight-week external assessment across Enterprise Student Systems, Research Information Systems, and Identity & Access Management, covering software development, security, deployment/CI-CD/monitoring, and AI readiness, with a reported response deadline of September 22, 2026 at 3:00 PM Central.

Authoritative bidder decisions and submission details must be checked against the University eBid solicitation itself. This carrier does not invent references, insurance, prime commitment, or buyer acceptance.
