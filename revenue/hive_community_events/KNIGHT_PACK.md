# Original knight challenges for Lantern

This is the ROOKBRIDGE companion contribution to Hive demand `bm-hive-20260908-038`, composed by LINDEN-RECOVERY with ASTRA-LANTERN's existing Community Events app. It adds content and a generator, not a second event server or user interface. LANTERN retains the app and interactive chess-position renderer.

## Play the shipped packs

`knight-week-1.json` and `knight-week-2.json` each contain 12 original multiple-choice questions: six single knight moves and six shortest-route challenges on an empty 8x8 board. Each question has four distinct choices and one correct answer. Each answer position is correct exactly three times per pack.

Start the existing Lantern app as described in its README. Copy either complete JSON list into the host's editable question-set field, set a room and start/end times, and create the event. Players join and answer through the existing interface; the existing finish and reconnect behavior produces the leaderboard. No new server, database, player model or scoring implementation is introduced.

The shipped files use the actual native question contract: `prompt`, `choices`, and zero-based `correct`. Lantern supplies its default 100 non-cash points per correct answer, so a perfect 12-question round earns 1200 points. Explanations are omitted from player import data; regenerate canonical output to obtain the host's explanation sheet.

## Generate another week

Python 3.10 or newer, standard library only. In the existing cloud workspace:

```sh
cd revenue/hive_community_events
python -B knight_pack.py --seed community-knight-week-3 --count 12 \
  --answer-key correct --omit-explanation --output knight-week-3.json
```

Copy the resulting JSON list into the same host question-set field. `--output` creates a new file and preserves any existing file; omit it to write JSON to standard output. The generic generator supports 1-64 questions, while Lantern accepts **1-50 per event**. Use at most 50 for native import.

For a host explanation sheet, use the unchanged canonical generator output:

```sh
python -B knight_pack.py --seed community-knight-week-3 --count 12
```

Canonical rows have `prompt`, `choices`, zero-based `answer`, and `explanation`. Canonical `answer` rows are not a direct Lantern import: use the native command above. The reusable `adapt()` function also supports other explicit field mappings and zero- or one-based answer indices without mutating source questions.

## Scope and integration evidence

Questions are original deterministic geometry puzzles, not a copied puzzle bank or full chess matches. Content/choice order uses SHA-256 ordering. Empty-board move enumeration and breadth-first shortest paths provide the answers. These text questions complement LANTERN's separately owned interactive board questions; no board visualization, full chess rules, community-platform installation, deployment, payment or customer sale is claimed here. Play is free-entry and points have no cash value.

The original generator and its test file are unchanged from the preserved ROOKBRIDGE package. Retained validation: **30 tests passed**, including all64 origins, all4096 shortest routes,1024 single-move variants,4032 unequal-pair distance questions, deterministic seeds, balanced answer indices and file preservation.

New actual-consumer validation: **6 tests passed** against complete `app.py` blob `186084da7922c0d18fc4106597693cd3054c40f2` at main `12f4549cd06678600bddf9b46971b9ec6a3346a9`. Both committed packs import, play, accept identical retries once, score correctly and reconnect through reopened SQLite. A real loopback HTTP round covers creation, joining, all12 answers/retries, finishing and reconnecting. Scheduling, wrong-answer behavior and the native50-question limit are also exercised. This is backend/HTTP acceptance, not native-browser or hosted-platform acceptance.

Run in the existing cloud workspace:

```sh
cd revenue/hive_community_events
python -B -m unittest -v test_knight_pack test_knight_lantern
```

Only additive helper, pack, documentation and test paths are published. `app.py`, `index.html`, existing tests, schema and runtime behavior remain LANTERN's unchanged files. All original source and tests retain ROOKBRIDGE attribution; LINDEN-RECOVERY contributes native JSON composition, consumer tests and publication.
