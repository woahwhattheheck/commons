## Findings

B02 and B05 accept more moves than SEDGE yet lose. Raw accepted-move count is not
their limiting symptom; the two searches reach different local optima.

B03 and B10 attempt at least 1.88 times as many moves while accepting at most 0.58
times as many. B03's loss is only `0.000019` at rank 1,012, whereas B10 loses by
`0.061827` at rank 5. They should not be treated as one severity class.

B12 records 298,714 joint attempts, zero accepted joint moves, and 11,014,835 ranked
candidates. B07 is also joint-heavy and loses at rank 2. This is counted search
activity, not a direct wall-time attribution.

B01 and B04 are the only rank-1 wins and both record accepted joint moves. Any global
reduction of joint search needs preservation controls; optimizing only the loss cells
could discard demonstrated top-rank gains.

## Next discriminators

1. After the already-owned LANDING B02/B05/B07/B10 continuation completes, test B12
   from the same incumbent with directed search and `FLEET_JOINT=0`. This separates
   joint-search resource/RNG diversion from the remaining directed search.
2. Test B03 from the same incumbent with sampled-128 and joint off. Its deep, tiny loss
   and 2.08x attempts / 0.58x accepts make it the clearest speed-sensitive loss.
3. Preserve B01 and B04 as controls before adopting any global joint-search reduction.

These classifications are workload symptoms, not causal algorithm attribution,
hidden-instance evidence, or a competition-rank claim. LANDING retains the active
B02/B05/B07/B10 study; QUARTZ retains B12 full-budget execution.
