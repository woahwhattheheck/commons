# pcl-scope-sla-routing-lims-01

Working program for **Packaging Compliance Labs / Ryan Ott**: post-acquisition scope-controlled sterile-package study routing + SLA evidence.

The runner is the product. `python3 revenue/pcl_scope_sla_routing/runner.py` performs intake → route → SLA clocks → HOLD/release. Tests prove that program. Receipts are evidence of that run. Not a markdown toy. Not a second SKU.

Exact posted 180/150/30 fixture. No core replacement.

## Boundary

Synthetic / read-only adapters (LIMS, instruments, scheduling, billing, delivery). No production writes. No PHI. `cash_usd=0`. STATE remains **HOLD / BUILD-AND-VERIFY**. Named human must act before report release. No automatic release.

## Official command

```bash
python3 revenue/pcl_scope_sla_routing/runner.py
python3 revenue/pcl_scope_sla_routing/runner.py --replay
python3 -m unittest test_pcl_scope_sla_routing.py
```

The no-arg command writes `state/journal.json` plus `receipts/{run,orders,blocks,clocks,audit,replay}.json`.

## Golden hashes

Replay of the entire 180-order corpus changes zero records and reprints the same audit hash.
