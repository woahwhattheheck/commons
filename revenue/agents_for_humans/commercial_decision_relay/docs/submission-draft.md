# Devpost submission draft

## Commercial Decision Relay

Commercial teams lose time repeatedly checking offer threads, matching versions, identifying exact acceptances, and separating routine outcomes from decisions that actually need a human. A naive AI assistant can make this worse by confidently turning ambiguous language into "closed" status.

Commercial Decision Relay is a Strands Agents SDK professional agent that handles that repetitive evidence loop end to end. Strands orchestrates custom evidence tools and lifecycle audit hooks. Before orchestration, the CLI preloads and locks trusted normalized evidence plus a caller-supplied trusted UTC instant. A deterministic engine binds responses to the current offer version, counterparty, thread, terms, amount, time window, human review attestation, and source digest. The agent stays quiet for routine waiting/decline states and surfaces only exact-acceptance-ready, counteroffer, clarification, expiry, late-response, or evidence-conflict decision cards.

The central design choice is a hard authority boundary: `HUMAN_CLOSING_READY` is not signer or legal authority. The project contains no capability to sign, execute contracts, create checkout/invoices, charge, begin fulfillment, or recognize revenue. Current receipt verification requires trusted source evidence, an independently supplied digest, and caller-supplied current UTC; a self-digest or historical receipt timestamp is never treated as current authority.

### Built with
- Strands Agents SDK 1.55.1 (Python; exact tested pin)
- Custom Strands tools
- Strands Before/AfterToolCall lifecycle hooks with exception/cancellation-aware audit status
- Optional Amazon Bedrock default provider or OpenAI provider
- Standard-library deterministic evidence engine and local decision dashboard

### What judges can reproduce free
1. Install dependencies and run the deterministic + SDK integration tests.
2. Reconcile the synthetic fixture into a create-exclusive receipt.
3. Verify the receipt against trusted evidence, independent digest, and trusted UTC.
4. Open the local decision dashboard.
5. Configure a supported model provider to exercise the Strands orchestration path with the fixture preloaded and locked.

### Prior work/open-source disclosure
This project was created during the Aug. 10–Sep. 14, 2026 submission period. Commercial-evidence patterns were informed by contemporaneous work in the `woahwhattheheck/commons` repository, including a commercial acceptance evidence bridge created during the same period. If any source is incorporated verbatim, the exact source commit/file will be disclosed in the final submission. The Strands-native orchestration, tool layer, audit hooks, product dashboard, fixtures, documentation, and hackathon packaging are new work for this project.
