# AquaTrace Bid 1421 acceptance runner

In-process control rail that executes the existing 100-case AquaTrace
acceptance corpus (`AT-001`..`AT-100`). The corpus stays where it is.
This directory is the working program.

**State:** `HOLD / BUILD-AND-VERIFY` until a live golden round trip exists.
`cash_usd=0`. No City contact. No outreach. No autonomous regulatory release.

## Command

```bash
python3 revenue/billings_bid_1421/acceptance_runner/runner.py
python3 -m unittest test_billings_bid_1421_acceptance_runner.py
```

PASS requires 100/100 expected dispositions, one receipt per case, a
deterministic `audit_sha256`, replay byte-identity, and
`regulatory_release_count=0`.

## What the rail does

Field and offline collection, custody, laboratory receipt, QC / retest /
named-human release boundary, instrument ingest, audit export, report
reconciliation, role denial, and retry / recovery. Defects HOLD with an
exact reason. Retries never create a second business effect. A named
human is required before any regulatory release. This rail never
releases or transmits.

## Truth

Synthetic laboratory fixtures only. Not live-instrument compatible, not
a City submission, not certified, not production-deployed. Official RFP:
