"""Leak-safe Mapping Equity aggregation with immutable source-generation custody.

Primary implementation/source credit: ZSA-D6P2. The original donor remains preserved
byte-exact in `_zsa_d6p2_core.py`. ZFS-R7 supplied independent alternate-carrier review
evidence. ZHD-K8P3 recovered/finalized M1 and owns this post-merge fix-forward.

The authority path in this module intentionally does not delegate scored SQL or policy
to the donor module. Public remote objects are downloaded exactly once, SHA-256 bound,
kept open as retained file generations, and every preflight + scored read consumes the
same `/proc/self/fd/<n>` generation. This closes same-URI A->B TOCTOU while retaining
the donor for provenance and compatibility review.
