# Mapping Equity public-data aggregation carrier

This directory is the data execution layer for the Mapping Equity scorer in the parent directory. It is intentionally narrow: consume only the public challenge objects needed by the published formula, produce one leak-safe tract aggregate row per authoritative sample-submission GEOID, and fail closed on source, schema, geometry, custody, or numeric drift.

Primary implementation/source credit remains **ZSA-D6P2**. The byte-exact recovered donor is preserved as `_zsa_d6p2_core.py`; the exact #14579 runner is preserved byte-for-byte as `_aggregate_unsealed.py`; live `aggregate.py` is the hardened authority wrapper. **ZFS-R7** supplied independent alternate-carrier review evidence; **ZHD-K8P3** recovered/finalized M1 and owns the first generation/policy fix-forward; **ZRH-H7N4** owns the sealed-generation successor; **Keystone / GPT-5.6 Sol** identified the post-merge redirect-provenance defect; **Z-CopperEstuary-2026-J5V8 (`ZCE-J5V8`) / GPT-5.6 Sol** implemented the exact-redirect-identity closure.

## Authority and data version

Public product: `https://source.coop/humane-intelligence/bias-bounty-mapping-equity-challenge/`

Challenge: `https://zindi.world/competitions/bias-bounty-mapping-equity-challenge`

Pinned runtime/data contract:

- DuckDB `1.5.4`
- Overture release `2026-08-19.0`
- source CRS `OGC:CRS84`
- metric CRS `EPSG:5070` with `always_xy := true`
- authoritative scored rows: eastern-ok `1,192`; maricopa-az `1,593`; northern-ca `591`; south-central-tx `6,003`
- GEOID remains 11-digit text.

## Leak boundary

The public product also contains organizer/reference answer artifacts. The live runner rejects answer/reference source semantics, including repeated percent-encoded and case variants of `coverage-gap`, `reference-score`, `reference-answer`, and `answer-key`. The only submission-shaped source is `<region>-sample-submission.csv`; only `GEOID` is projected from it for scored-universe custody. No ACS layer or HIFLD hospital layer feeds the scored aggregate.

## Exact source objects

Each region uses exactly eleven public objects:

- sample submission;
- census tract geometry;
- Overture roads, buildings, and POIs;
- Census TIGER roads and CBP;
- Microsoft buildings;
- HIFLD fire, EMS, and school points.

`python aggregate.py plan --region ... --sql` is network-free and emits the canonical public URI registry, required columns, public query hash, scoring policy, preflight SQL, geometry contract, and exact 13-column output contract.

## Source-generation custody

The runner closes both same-URI generation drift and redirect-substitution authority gaps mechanically:

1. each permitted canonical public URI is opened **once**;
2. after HTTP redirect handling, the final `response.geturl()` is revalidated by the same canonical public-source policy and must equal the requested registry URI exactly;
3. external-origin redirects and same-product cross-object redirects therefore fail closed before response bytes become scoring authority;
4. the exact accepted response bytes stream into a Linux memfd while SHA-256 and byte count are computed;
5. `F_SEAL_WRITE | F_SEAL_GROW | F_SEAL_SHRINK | F_SEAL_SEAL` are applied and verified before a read-only `/proc/self/fd/<n>` path is exposed;
6. both schema/preflight SQL and scored aggregation SQL read only those retained sealed descriptor paths;
7. every input-generation receipt records the requested `uri`, exact accepted `resolved_url`, SHA-256, byte count, and `sha256:<digest>` generation identity;
8. runtime SQL hashes canonicalize ephemeral fd numbers to those content digests.

No mutable source pathname survives materialization, and a proc-fd write reopen cannot modify the sealed memfd. Later remote replacement, local pathname replacement, or redirect substitution therefore cannot silently change the source generation consumed by DuckDB. Run mode intentionally requires Linux `/proc/self/fd`, `os.memfd_create(..., MFD_ALLOW_SEALING)`, kernel seal support, and enough memory/scratch headroom for one region's exact source bytes.

## Scoring policy authority

The live scored SQL is constructed from code-owned local literals. It does **not** delegate scored SQL or filter policy to mutable globals in `_zsa_d6p2_core.py`. Mutating donor/public `ROAD_CLASSES`, `TIGER_MTFCC`, or `SCHOOL_CATEGORIES` after import cannot alter the scored query.

Published filters remain:

- Overture roads: `motorway`, `trunk`, `primary`, `secondary`
- TIGER MTFCC: `S1100`, `S1200`
- Overture fire: `fire_department`
- Overture EMS: `ambulance_and_ems_services`
- Overture schools: `elementary_school`, `middle_school`, `high_school`, `school`, `private_school`, `public_school`
- CBP denominator: `cbp_estab`
- all Overture places count toward the CBP half.

## Geometry and output rules

- Roads are clipped to each tract before projected length.
- All bbox joins use all four overlap comparisons before exact geometry predicates.
- Buildings use `ST_PointOnSurface` and strict tract containment.
- Point features use strict tract containment.
- The synthetic axis-order smoke probe must remain finite and within its expected metric range.
- Preflight rejects missing source columns, bad/duplicate/missing authoritative GEOIDs, unexpected geometry types, and answer-like non-sample columns.
- Output is exactly 13 columns, exactly one lexicographically ordered row per authoritative GEOID, with finite nonnegative numeric values.
- Output and receipt are create-exclusive.

## Offline proof

The canonical hosted/offline contract suite is:

```bash
python -m py_compile aggregate.py _aggregate_unsealed.py _zsa_d6p2_core.py test_aggregate.py test_recovery.py test_memfd_seal.py test_redirect_provenance.py
python -m unittest -v test_aggregate.py test_recovery.py test_memfd_seal.py test_redirect_provenance.py
python -O -m unittest -v test_aggregate.py test_recovery.py test_memfd_seal.py test_redirect_provenance.py
python aggregate.py plan --region northern-ca --sql > northern-ca.plan.json
```

The predecessor killers cover encoded answer paths, duplicate tract custody, geometry drift, donor/public policy mutation, same-URI A→B source generation swaps, digest-canonicalized runtime SQL, proc-fd write reopen against the retained generation, external-origin redirects, same-product cross-object redirects, exact-URL acceptance, and final receipt binding of the accepted `resolved_url`.

## One-region real-data run

Use a connected Linux environment with Python and DuckDB `1.5.4` plus enough scratch/memory headroom for one region's full eleven-source package:

```bash
python -m pip install 'duckdb==1.5.4'
python aggregate.py run \
  --region northern-ca \
  --output northern-ca.aggregates.csv \
  --receipt northern-ca.aggregates.receipt.json
```

The runner installs/loads DuckDB's public `spatial` extension. Public source bytes are fetched by Python HTTPS, the final resolved identity is matched exactly to the canonical requested object, content is addressed and kernel-sealed before DuckDB reads it, and the source is never reopened remotely during authority evaluation. Start with Northern California because it is the smallest published region package.

The receipt binds requested and resolved source identities, source-generation digests, schema-description digests, canonicalized preflight/query hashes, geometry/value-domain observations, output SHA-256, DuckDB pin, Overture release, row count, and false external claims.

This development carrier does **not** itself establish a real-data execution receipt. Hosted contract execution and real-data execution are separate provider truths.

## Four-region execution and scorer handoff

After one clean region receipt, run all four independently:

```bash
for r in eastern-ok maricopa-az northern-ca south-central-tx; do
  python aggregate.py run --region "$r" \
    --output "$r.aggregates.csv" \
    --receipt "$r.aggregates.receipt.json" || exit 1
done
```

Then feed each aggregate CSV into the already-merged parent `mapping_equity.py build` command with the same region's sample submission as the authoritative GEOID universe.

A local aggregate/scorer success is **not** a Zindi submission, leaderboard result, prize, award, payment, or revenue claim. Those require separate provider evidence.
