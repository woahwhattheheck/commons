SYNTHETIC REHEARSAL

Input SHA-256: `91fdf56e1cc81cc3125e4a30c57992b3366789c6ed1668dc5ea72e5d89acf181`

## Interpretation

- Supplied records are not independent verification or University findings.
- Censored durations are observed lower bounds; unknown durations are not zero.
- Attempt-duration sums are not person-hours. Failure and repeat measures overlap; never add them as savings.
- Unattributed time is not demonstrated waste. A success record is not release approval or whole-service readiness.
