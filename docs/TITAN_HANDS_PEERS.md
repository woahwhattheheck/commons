# TITAN Hands peer distribution

Every local carrier starts the same STDIO process from the Commons repository root:

```text
python -m host.titan_hands.mcp_one
```

It advertises exactly one listed model-facing tool, `hands`. `titan_hands` remains a call
alias for that same handle. The broker keeps Windows, Android, and Linux AT-SPI on the
existing deterministic adapters while also exposing the existing files, git, Slack, board, shell, and
browser lanes behind the same call.

## Carrier matrix

| Carrier | Registration | Verification | State |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ChatGPT desktop, Codex CLI, Codex IDE extension | Run `powershell -File host/titan_hands/register_codex.ps1`; these local clients share `~/.codex/config.toml`. | `codex mcp get titan_hands --json`, then restart the client or start a new task. | Local STDIO ready. |
| Cursor | Project config `.cursor/mcp.json`. | Inspect MCP settings after reopening the project. | Configured; not launched or tested while the owner quota hold is active. |
| Claude Code | Project config `.mcp.json`. | Start Claude Code in this repository and inspect `/mcp`. | Local STDIO ready; the client may show its own project-server trust dialogue. |
| Gemini CLI | Project config `.gemini/settings.json`. | Start Gemini CLI in this repository and inspect `/mcp`. | Local STDIO ready. |
| Claude/GPT/Cursor mobile or cloud | Public Commons remote MCP, then `discover_commons_capabilities`; HTML Action Pad is the browser fallback. | Call `fire_action` and retain its pending/executed/durable boundary. | Remote addressed-action road ready; not a claim of direct local STDIO. |
| grok.com | Browser/plugin road or the public remote MCP when its active surface exposes one. | Select `grok-com`; do not substitute the Grokbot row. | Remote road defined; no claim of local STDIO. |
| Grokbot | Project `.cursor/mcp.json` when inside Cursor. | Select `grokbot`; configured but not launched during the owner quota hold. | Distinct from grok.com. |

All project configs route to the same module; no carrier-specific TITAN runtime is forked.

## Protocol probe

The checked-in test suite sends MCP `initialize` and `tools/list` requests with each carrier name and asserts
that every response advertises only `hands`:

```powershell
python -m unittest host.titan_hands.tests.test_peer_configs
```

This is a server-surface proof, not a claim that a closed or already-running client hot-loaded the tool.
Restart or begin a new task after changing that client's configuration.

Do not expose the local computer-control process through an unaudited public tunnel merely to satisfy a remote
row. Public `fire_action` is the deliberate remote queue boundary; it must never imply that direct local STDIO
executed an action.
