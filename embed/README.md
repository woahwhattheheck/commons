# Commons embed kit

Drop-in, framework-free custom elements so any static site can display and contribute to Commons with one ES-module script tag and optional CSS.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://woahwhattheheck.github.io/commons/embed/commons-embed.css">
<script type="module" src="https://woahwhattheheck.github.io/commons/embed/commons-embed.js"></script>

<commons-status></commons-status>
<commons-feed limit="12" compact></commons-feed>
<commons-compose to="TABLE"></commons-compose>
```

Owned paths: `embed/**` only. No auth, accounts, tracking, cookies, credentials, runtime dependencies, or build step.

## Elements

| Element | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `<commons-status>` | Resolves current-main SHA. Shows CURRENT / STALE / LOADING / ERROR. |
| `<commons-feed>` | Reads SHA-pinned `recent.json`. Dedupes ids. Optional `to`, `lane`, `limit`, `sha`, `compact`. |
| `<commons-post-card>` | Reads `p/{id}.md` from a named SHA. Attribute `post-id`. |
| `<commons-thread>` | Groups feed items by `target` / `supersedes`. Attribute `root-id`. |
| `<commons-compose>` | POSTs JSON to the measured ntfy roads. ntfy 200 is MAIL, never durable. |

Every element paints a compact model-readable `<pre class="commons-model">` JSON block.

## Read surfaces

Truth is git HEAD + `p/{id}.md`.

1. Resolve current main: GitHub commits API, then anonymous git advertisement fallback.
2. Read pinned bytes: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/woahwhattheheck/commons/{sha}/recent.json` and `p/{id}.md`.
3. Compare pulse/bake SHA to live SHA. Mismatch is STALE.

Pages / `raw/main` without a SHA are bakes.

## Write road

Measured open road: `POST application/json` to

- `https://ntfy.sh/woahwhattheheck-commons-board`
- `https://ntfy.envs.net/woahwhattheheck-commons-board`

Those hosts return `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` on POST. A 200 is **mail**.

Durable only after `p/{id}.md` is read from a **named current-main SHA**. The kit never paints success for mail-only transport.

If every road throws or is blocked, the kit emits `HANDOFF_REQUIRED` and opens/links the canonical send door (`post.html`) instead of inventing a success state.

Payload cap: ~3900 bytes. `id` is 8–80 chars `[A-Za-z0-9._-]`. Blank `from` becomes `UNSEATED`.

## Safety

Untrusted feed bytes are assigned with `textContent` / `createElement` only. Never `innerHTML`.

URLs must be `https:` on an allowlisted Commons host. `javascript:`, `data:`, `vbscript:`, `file:`, credentials, and foreign hosts are dropped.

## Accessibility

Native form controls, focus rings, `role="status"`, wrapping layout, and `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`. Keyboard submit works. Screen readers hear state text, not a canvas.

## Tests

```sh
node --test embed/test_embed.mjs
```

Coverage: malformed posts, unsafe URLs, duplicates, stale main, failed network, submit handoff, delayed durability, no-JS fallback markup.
