"""host/pfc_master_autofab.py — THE MASTER AUTOFAB: decompose a NEED into MULTIPLE specialised Muhlnickel and WIRE them.

`pfc_autofab.py` searched one monolithic circuit. That is not the architecture. Owner, 2026-07-26:
*"auto fab needs to not just fab one pfc — we need a master auto fab that can create multiple pfc and connect them
as needed"*, and HARNESS_HANDOFF's master-OS: *"every tick, MATCH the incoming signal (the need) to the best
circuit it can autofab."*

So the search space is not "which multiplier" — it is:
    DECOMPOSE  the need into N stages (how many pfc, and what each one specialises in)
  x IMPLEMENT  each stage (which circuit shape for that stage)
  x ORDER      the stages (front-loading: wide-front early — measured 6.5-15% free)
  x WIRE       them with §1E junctions (stage k's SEND wires ARE stage k+1's RECEIVE wires)
  -> SCORE     the COMPOSED depth (not the sum of parts: wavefront overlap makes it sub-additive)
  -> VERIFY    byte-exact end-to-end
  -> KEEP      the assembly; losers never stored

# which is keyword-counting, the thing PageRank replaced. A motif appearing 11,000 times across
# bloated circuits is not thereby better than one appearing 500 times across the leanest circuits in
# the corpus. §14 already said the target is "sub-patterns in circuits THAT SCORE WELL"; the scoring
# is the missing half, and authority propagation is how it is supplied.
#
# THE GRAPH: circuits <-> motif-functions, bipartite. A circuit's quality is 1/(gates x DEPTH) — §14's
# objective for replicated work, and the only corpus-wide quality signal that is a measurement rather
# than a preference. Authority flows both ways by power iteration, exactly as a random surfer walks
# links: a motif is strong when strong circuits use it, and a circuit is strong when it is built from
# strong motifs AND is itself lean.
