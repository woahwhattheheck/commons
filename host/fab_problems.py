"""host/fab_problems.py — FABRICATION ONLY. Stores the winners the fabricator found for the thrown
problems, so the corpus grows and the owner's theory becomes measurable.

Owner's theory: *"throwing different stuff at it will optimize it."* The mechanism, per §14, is that
the mined motif library is built FROM the corpus — "discover recurring sub-patterns in circuits that
score well, promote them to named primitives, and re-search with the enlarged library." A circuit
that is never stored cannot contribute a motif, so testing the theory requires storing the winners.

BASELINE, measured before these were added: 280,561 cones evaluated, **702 distinct functions**.
Re-mine after storing and the difference is the theory's answer, either way.

Every winner here passed the full bar in `mafab_problems.py` before reaching this file: exact
reference implemented INDEPENDENTLY of the circuit (§3), and every mutant CAUGHT (§45C/§47B).

ADDITIVE: new names only. Nothing existing is touched.
