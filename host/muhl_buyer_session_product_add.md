# Buyer session — the computer is not the product

The computer is the file. That is the physics, proven on this device. **The computer is not the product.** The paid closed-room NDA is a look, not a transfer.

## What the buyer does not leave with

- `titan.gguf`
- a pfc copy
- the foundry
- reproduction instructions

No USB, no email, no screenshot of internals, no “take this binary home.” Copying the file copies the computer — that is why the file stays in the room.

## What they watch (in the room, under NDA)

Inject / surface / White Box on **their model** or a **demo GGUF that is not titan**.

The host injects a bounded signal and surfaces a bounded answer. White Box edits meaning without inference. `cpu_fwd` runs the connected software. Titan is the computer in the room. It is not the takeaway.

## Fail closed — titan must not copy to the buyer

Refuse any path that would copy titan to the buyer. That includes:

- `--model` aimed at `titan.gguf` or any pfc binary
- copying `titan.gguf`, a `.pfc`, foundry/gene/genome, or allocator layout off this machine
- printing a live titan dump to stdout (offsets, tensor slots, gene, allocator)
- handing the buyer reproduction steps for the fabricator

If the existing session script is asked to connect titan as the “model,” do not run that command. Point `--model` at the buyer’s GGUF or at a demo GGUF that is not titan. Default remains dry. Live instrument wraps stay in-room; their stdout is not a titan dump the buyer keeps.

## Relation to the session runtime

`muhl_buyer_session_add.py` is the in-room script. Default dry. SHOW vs SECRET still prints. This file wins where that pair could be misread as “the buyer gets the computer.”

Physics: the file is the computer; copy the file, copy the computer.  
Sale: they do not get the file.
