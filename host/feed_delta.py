"""Seq-keyed delta shards so "what changed since I last looked" is a small read.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
`pulse.json` is the freshness beacon: 866 bytes, a monotonic `seq`, stable
across no-op rebuilds. A session compares one integer and learns it is behind.
Its instruction then sends that session to `recent.json`, which carries the full
body of 500 posts. A session that refreshes honestly pays that read every time,
so the cheap check has no cheap answer behind it.

These shards are the answer. Both are static files, so they serve from Pages
with no endpoint, no auth and no per-caller state:

    feed/head.json     newest HEAD_N events, each with a bounded excerpt
    feed/window.json   every dated event in the bake, headline only

CURSOR
------
The cursor is a single sortable string per event:

    c = "<durable_ts>|<id>"

`durable_ts` is when the post landed, not when it was authored. Landing order
is the only order that cannot skip a record: a post authored yesterday and
ingested today sorts by today, so a session whose cursor is already past
yesterday still sees it. Author time travels alongside as `ts` for display.

The bake stamps one `durable_ts` per ingest batch, so many events share a
timestamp (measured: 496 records over 82 distinct values). A bare timestamp
comparison would drop every event that shares the boundary second, which is
why the id is part of the cursor and the comparison is a plain string compare.

`durable_ts` never contains "|", so the id is recovered with
`c.split("|", 1)[1]` whatever the id contains.

HONESTY
-------
* A record with no landing time and no author time cannot be ordered. It is not
  quietly dropped: its id is listed in `undated` on both shards, and `since()`
  reports an explicit unordered gap that requires a full read.
* If `recent.json` cannot be read, or reads as something other than a non-empty
  list, this writes nothing and exits non-zero. An empty feed would tell every
  session that nothing happened.
* Each shard declares `complete_since`, the oldest cursor it contains. A session
  whose cursor sorts below that value is told its gap is wider than the shard
  rather than handed a short answer.
* Output is byte-stable: rebuilding with unchanged inputs reproduces the
  identical file, including `built_at`, so a no-op bake makes no diff.

Stdlib only. No network. Reads two files, writes two files.
