"""host/pfc_propagation.py — SINGLE-BIT SIGNAL PROPAGATION, measured, no speculation (owner 07-20: "we seriously want
to see propagation with a single bit signal and if its not possible how close can we get, let the data speak").

Bake a real gate chain into titan.gguf's physical bytes with SHARED-ADDRESS wiring (gate k's output byte IS gate k+1's
input byte — §1E). Then run three arms and MEASURE the propagation depth (how many downstream gates actually reach the
signal's value), all with bounded ~0-RAM byte probes (the multimeter):
  A — POWER, RAW READ: apply the signal (flip the input bit), then read the raw stored downstream bytes. No debug tool.
  B — POWER, DEBUG READ-OUT: apply the signal, then read the circuit's output with a bounded (depth-only) DEBUG probe.
      The circuit is the computer (powered = it computes); the probe is a DEBUG read-out, NOT the compute.
  C — CRUTCH (baseline, banned): a resident whole-wire-vector host ripple — shown only for contrast, never the runtime.
Let the data say the depth for each. Reversible (genome).
