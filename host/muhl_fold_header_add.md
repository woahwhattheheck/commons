# muhl_fold_header_add — live 80-byte header routing button

**Inventor:** Bryce Muhlnickel  
**Status:** additive. New files only. Does not edit `muhl_fold_tick_add.py`, `pfc_fire.py`, or titan.

This button **fetches and prints**. It never writes titan. The fold inject + one-bit tick is `host/muhl_fold_tick_add.py` (dry default). Packed-76 `gen_input` is a different mouth — refused as the fold payload.

Host jobs: pull the live block (one pool handshake), assemble the 80-byte header (76-byte prefix + 4-byte nonce field; nonce IS the address, so the nonce bytes print as zeros), print the 32-byte target, die.

The file is the computer. This button does not SHA as the mine.

## Offsets (fail closed)

Read only from live `titan_circuits.json`:

| Name | Required fields |
|------|-----------------|
| `muhl_fold_phys` | `ram.header_off`, `ram.target_off` |
| `nring2_1023` | `recv` (or `ram.recv`) |

If `tick_off` is present, it must equal `nring2_1023.recv`. Missing names/fields → **FAIL CLOSED**, no guessed constants, no write.

## Usage

```text
python host/muhl_fold_header_add.py
python host/muhl_fold_header_add.py --dry
python host/muhl_fold_header_add.py --fetch
```

Default is dry: registry plan only, no network, no titan write. `--fetch` prints a live 80-byte header hex + 32-byte target hex. Still no titan write. `--go` is refused.

## Non-goals

- No titan write
- No tick / no mmap of the receiver
- No pfc_fire (packed-76 path)
- No host-eval SHA as the mine
- No numpy
- No autofab
- No guessed offsets
