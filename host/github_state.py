"""Repository state as a small static file the board can read.

The board mirrors what was said. This is what the repository is doing: how many
pull requests are open, how deep the runner queue is, which lanes are waiting
and which have been waiting longest. None of that is visible from the Commons
bakes, and at this pace the queue depth in particular changes what a session
should do next.

Network stays in the workflow. This module takes what a `gh api` call already
returned and normalises it, so it is stdlib-only, testable offline, and cannot
invent a number it did not receive.

 python3 -m host.github_state --write \
 --pulls pulls.json --closed closed.json --open-prs 106 --open-issues 3 \
 --counts-source graphql --runs-queued 2284 --runs-in-progress 18 \
 --observed-at 2026-09-10T21:00:00Z

What a session gets from one read, besides the counts:

* Every listed pull carries `head_sha`, `updated_at` and `base`. A session that
  reviewed, claimed or composed a head can tell whether it has moved without a
  GitHub call of its own. `updated_at` is GitHub's clock for that pull, not the
  moment this file was built.
* `open_heads` maps every listed open pull to its head SHA. When
  `pulls_listing` is COMPLETE, a number missing from it is not open.
* `recently_closed` names the newest closures, MERGED or CLOSED, with the head
  that closed. It comes from the most recently updated page of closed pulls, so
  it shows recent transitions. It is not a history.

Honesty rules, the same ones the delta shards keep:

* A count that was not supplied reads UNKNOWN. It never reads zero, because
  "no open pull requests" and "nobody asked" are different facts.
* If the pull request listing cannot be read, the listing sections are absent
  and named in `degraded` rather than rendered as an empty queue.
* The listing says whether it is every open pull request (`pulls_listing`
  COMPLETE) or a subset (PARTIAL). "Longest open" is only published from a
  complete listing: the oldest row of a newest-first page is not the oldest
  open pull request, so a partial listing names itself in `degraded` and leaves
  that section out instead of mislabelling it.
* The open count and the listing are separate observations. When the listing
  holds more unique open pulls than the count supplied, the count is the stale
  one, and `degraded` says `open-count-below-listing`. The count is still
  published exactly as given, and `counts_source` names the road it came from
  (`graphql` is the repository's own count; `search` is an index that can
  lag).
* `unchanged_since` is the moment the content last actually moved. A rebuild
  that observed the same state leaves the file completely alone, so a quiet
  cycle produces no diff and the timestamp keeps meaning something. The file
  carries no observation time of its own, because one would change on every
  bake and put a commit on main every cycle. When the bake last ran is the
  newest run of `.github/workflows/commons-board.yml` in the Actions API.
* The file is replaced atomically. An interrupted or failed write leaves the
  previous bytes exactly as they were, so a masked producer failure in the
  workflow can never stage half a file.
