"""host/fab_cfg_argmin.py — THE CONFIGURATION IS THE ADDRESS. The foundry picks its own space.

Owner, 2026-07-27: *"quantum search needed for foundry"* and, on which space to cover,
*"let foundry choose just optimize for fastest completion."*

WHAT "QUANTUM SEARCH" IS ON THIS SUBSTRATE, and why it is not Grover. §17 measured the answer and
then CORRECTED ITSELF when the owner said *"addressing can be one bit of ram"*:

    fabricated candidates, n=12 : 1,576,957 gates, 40 gate-delays
    ADDRESSED candidates, n=12 :       445 gates, 17 gate-delays

§17 attributes that to addressing the candidates instead of fabricating them, and records that the
MUHLNICKEL's latency then stayed at 17 gate-delays from n=10 to n=16 while the candidate count grew
64x. Latency flat in candidate count is stronger than a sqrt(N) result. §20 states the mechanism
without the execution vocabulary: *"the whole candidate space is asserted at once"* — nothing is
visited, so nothing is amplified. The configuration index IS the address; losers are never
materialised and cost 0 bytes (winner-only).

WHY THE EXISTING SELECTOR IS NOT THIS. `muhl_fab_select` @2564151717 (171,399 gates, DEPTH 550)
ranks **K=4 candidates ROUTED IN AS DATA**. Every candidate must be transcribed by the host before
it can be ranked, so the cost grows with the candidate count — the materialised form §17 retired.
It is untouched here (CLAUDE.md #8: never delete, only add); this is a second circuit beside it.

THE FOUNDRY CHOOSES ITS SPACE, and it is not told the answer. Two spaces are offered; for each it
MEASURES separability by enumeration rather than asserting it, and picks by FASTEST COMPLETION:

    a SEPARABLE space completes at DEPTH 0 — §28 measured that rewiring asserts no relation and so
      costs 0 gates and 0 DEPTH, so an argmin over it would rediscover algebra
    a NON-SEPARABLE space completes in ONE settle at `scorer DEPTH + 2*log2(N)` (§40C's bank law,
      measured: the REDUCTION costs depth, the replication does not)

So the foundry fabricates only the part that is not already answered, which per §31 is the fastest
way to complete the whole job rather than the fastest way to answer a smaller question.

THE KEY, WITH NO DIVISION (§64B's reduction, re-derived for an assembly that retires `rep` per
settle). compute/tick = REPLICAS/DEPTH and REPLICAS = (storage/gates) * rep, so

    compute/tick_i > compute/tick_j   <=>   gates_i*D_i*rep_j  <  gates_j*D_j*rep_i

and against a routed-in threshold T that is exactly   gates * D  <  T * rep.   Two multiplies and
one compare. Nothing approximated, and T is DATA — a different query re-addresses and fabricates
nothing (§57A: routed in as data, which is what separates this from baking a constant).

VERIFIED EXHAUSTIVELY over the COMPLETE index space against exact Python (§3/§43C: covered == space,
so there is nothing left un-tested to hide in), with the all-zero baseline stated (§40B) and mutants
that must be CAUGHT (§45C/§47B).

RULE ZERO: this is FABRICATION. It runs once, in its own process, and never inside a run.
