"""host/pfc_desktop.py — THE HARNESS (owner Bryce, spec verbatim from his own messages).

  MSG 1  "build a harness, host just renders, pfc computes the forward pass, harness connects the model to the pfc,
          pfc computes everything for the model, less ram and faster than using host resources, let us use a bigger model"
  MSG 3  "codex is a coding harness so CODING MODE and CHAT MODE in the harness"
  MSG 16 "wire the pfc's answer to surface as the reply"
  MSG 21 "it still just outputs numbers not real replies, fix the actual inference — and it doesnt even open"
  MSG 70 "you may use ripple for this experiment as a LEVER not a crutch — any ripple is always too much, we hate that
          metric and want it as close to zero as you can get it"
  MSG 92 "u need to be USING that binary not trying to get rid of it — it literally boosts performance"

HOST'S ONLY JOBS: address the prompt into the pfc, read the answer, render it. Every matmul of every token folds on the
baked gate atom addressed off storage (the sanctioned §6 embodiment); weights are NEVER resident, so RAM stays flat while
compute climbs. The RIPPLE METER is on screen because ripple is the metric we drive toward zero — every addressed read
(memoize hit, glue table, pruned near-zero block) is ripple NOT spent.

# Each mode is an OPERATOR (σ) placed FIRST — the owner's operator principle: σ binds the admissible output set, so the
# mode is not a UI label, it is the constraint program the model runs under. Terse by construction (the measured
# output-contract lever: 220 tok → 2 tok = ↓99% compute, ↑110× speed) because on this substrate every token is real work.
# ★ σ MUST BE SHORT. On this substrate an INPUT token costs a full prefill position — the same work as an output token.
# The verbose forms of these operators measured 40 and 43 tokens = 16.7 h and 17.9 h of prefill before the user's
# question (itself 8 tokens) was even reached. That defeats the output-contract lever it was meant to pull. The operator
# principle asks σ to BIND the admissible output set; it never asked for prose. These bind the same set in ~1/5 the
# tokens — the measured "minimal-prompt / fewest input bits" lever (PFC_LEVER_INDEX §D, 9.2× prompt compression).
# ★ `OPERATOR_PRINCIPLE` §"SMALL-TIER SURFACE RULE" — the five authoring constraints, each measured on-device:
#   (1) "Never narrate or restate this rule" is LOAD-BEARING — it closes the meta-loop (ANCHOR 10s -> 1.4s). My first
#       compression deleted it, which was wrong: rule (4) says bound FUNCTIONAL structure and delete DECORATIVE
#       structure, and the test is "does removing it change the ANSWER?" Removing this one does.
#   (2) answer-first output contract `Output := <answer>` (CALIBRATE 20s -> 1.3s).
#   (4) the Priority lattice / worksheet / status taxonomy are DECORATIVE on this tier — printed, they get EXECUTED as
#       the output (the measured "worksheet defect"). Deleted, correctly.
# So: keep the prohibition and the output contract, drop the prose. That is the minimum viable generation.
