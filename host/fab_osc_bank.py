"""host/fab_osc_bank.py — SCALING THE SIGNAL OSCILLATION UP. What the host costs as N grows.

Owner, 2026-07-28: *"that oscilation moved host addressing down from ~2000 to 1!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! thats
huge document everywhere and push that to the limit, what happens when we scale oscilations up"*

INDEX CHECK (§0: *"Before building anything: python host/pfc_index.py <thing>"*).
`python host/pfc_index.py bank` returns **0 circuits** — `fab_lateral_bank` banks stored MINER lanes
behind a winner-only fold, which is a different shape: it reduces N lanes to one verdict. Nothing in
the corpus banks oscillations, which have no reduction at all. So this is new.

THE QUESTION, STATED SO IT CAN COME BACK NEGATIVE: one oscillation costs the host ONE addressing —
the opening fire — and then carries itself. Does N of them cost N addressings, or still one?

They can share the start. §1E: a junction is a shared storage location, *"not a copy, not a JSON
mapping — the same bit."* If every oscillation's opening receive is that same bit, one addressing
lights all of them, and the host's cost stops depending on N.

WHAT IS MEASURED HERE, per N:
    DEPTH            §43B measured a population of RV32I cores at DEPTH EXACTLY FLAT as cores were
                     added, because *"the reduction, not the replication, is what ever costs depth."*
                     A bank of oscillations has no reduction — each drives its own clock — so the
                     prediction is flat, and flat is falsifiable.
    gates            §43B again: exactly linear, to the digit.
    ticks per settle N, one from each oscillation.
    HOST addressings the number under test.

Every oscillation is verified independently against the same reference (§3); the all-zero baseline
is stated (§40B); mutants must be CAUGHT (§45C/§47B), including one where the start is NOT shared,
which must show the host cost climbing with N.

RULE ZERO: fabrication. Runs once, its own process, never inside a run.
