"""host/pfc_preflight.py — THE OWNER'S SPEC, EXECUTABLE. A rule not enforced by a script gets violated.

There is no waiver mechanism in this file and none may be added. When the checker catches something,
the CODE gets fixed — never the checker. If a rule is imprecise, make the RULE more precise (that is
what `requires` is for: a compliance pattern that must ALSO be present). Precision is not exemption:
an exemption says "this violation is allowed here"; a `requires` says "this is only a violation when
the mandated companion is absent." The first is forbidden. The second is the rule stated correctly.

A MINING file submits, fires, or reads an answer register at runtime.
A FABRICATION file (fab_*, *_fab.py) may build freely — that is RULE ZERO: manufacturing is a
different process, off the clock, and it happens once.

# ══ THE AUDIT — the inverse question. Not "is this file clean?" but "which rules are ALIVE, and which
#    are being violated, right now, across everything?"  §45C applied to the CHECKER ITSELF: a rule that
#    has never demonstrated it can fire is UNPROVEN, not working. Each rule carries a PROBE — a snippet
#    that MUST trip it. A probe that does not fire means the rule is broken, definitively.
#    Known-bad corpus (SESSION_HANDOFF §"FILES I CREATED THAT VIOLATE SPEC"): muhl_mine, pfc_btc_live,
#    pfc_btc_bench — "all three contain the host executor ... kept, but must not be run."
# ── ANTI-PROBES: fixtures each rule must stay SILENT on. ─────────────────────────────────────────
# A PROBE proves a rule CAN fire. It does not prove the rule fires only where it should. Every rule
# added on 2026-07-27/28 came out loose and was narrowed by hand — V52 fired on ~150 files including
# `b = 0`, V53 on the owner's own quoted words and the patent text, V54 on the word "so", V24 on the
# one receiver write the spec REQUIRES. Each narrowing was a judgement with nothing checking it.
# These fixtures are that check: the exact case the narrowing was written for. A future edit that
# re-loosens a rule fails here instead of silently flooding the audit again.
