"""Every tracked source file must still be readable by its own language.

On 2026-08-24 commit 0759ccf ("Add automatic failed-payload salvage loop") wrote
a harness truncation marker into the middle of board_ingest.py:

    bits.appe…7248 tokens truncated…

board_ingest.py went 148,523 -> 120,109 bytes in one push.  The file stopped
parsing, so `import board_ingest` raised SyntaxError and 25 root test files
cascade-failed on the import alone.  That file is the publisher: every write
road -- web form, Slack, ntfy, GitHub issue -- terminates in it.  Main carried a
publisher that could not start for as long as nobody happened to look.

This was the THIRD time.  import-check.yml's header records the first two:

    board_ingest.py  81940 -> 26 -> 5021 -> 59 bytes
    hub_pages.py     71530 -> 39 -> 288 -> 26 -> 288

All three were an agent rewriting a whole file when it meant to add to one.

The obvious check -- ban the characters truncation markers are made of -- does
not work here and was measured before it was written.  U+2026 already appears
330 times across tracked source, legitimately, inside strings and comments
(accordion.js, board.js, board_ingest.py itself).  A character ban is 330 false
positives and one true one, which is a check nobody keeps.

The question that has no false positives is the one the language itself answers:
does the file still parse?  Measured over the tree at the time of writing, 1,112
tracked .py files parse and exactly one does not -- the corrupted publisher.
That is the whole signal.  Red here means something on this branch cannot run
right now, not that somebody's style is unusual.

SCOPE, AND WHY IT IS NARROW.  This reads *source* -- .py and .js -- and nothing
else.  Board records, p/*.md, generated projections, excerpts, and every other
byte a player can post are data, and data may contain anything at all, including
the exact bytes that broke the publisher.  This program cannot reject a post, a
claim, an id, a seat, or a road, and must never be extended until it can.  It is
not an admission gate and there is nothing here for one to attach to.
