# Erdős 153 exact-value extension: finite certificates for `f(5)`, `f(6)`, `f(7)`

This carrier advances the live Conjectures.io Erdős #153 target without duplicating the existing published contribution. The sponsor's current contribution index already contains a 59-declaration piece proving an infimum-free interface, attainment, a finite-search theorem `Contribution.Erdos153Gaps.f_eq_of_search`, exact values `f(2)=2/3`, `f(3)=4/3`, `f(4)=9/5`, and an asymptotic lower bound with ceiling 16. This carrier starts exactly where that piece stops.

## Exact finite result

The dependency-free checker exhausts **every** `n`-subset of `range(D+1)`, checks the exact Formal-Conjectures Sidon condition via uniqueness of unordered pair sums, computes `A+A`, and evaluates the gap energy with `fractions.Fraction`. The cutoffs are the smallest integer `D` satisfying the published `f_eq_of_search` cutoff inequality for the displayed candidate value.

| n | D | all subsets | Sidon subsets | exact window minimum | minimizers | witness |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| 5 | 12 | 1,287 | 22 | `14/5` | 8 | `{0,1,4,9,11}` |
| 6 | 19 | 38,760 | 80 | `74/21` | 6 | `{0,1,4,10,15,17}` |
| 7 | 29 | 2,035,800 | 760 | `9/2` | 30 | `{0,1,4,10,18,23,25}` |

Together with the already-published and Lean-checked theorem `f_eq_of_search`, these finite premises identify the next three exact values **provided they are replayed inside that Lean interface**:

- `Erdos153.f 5 = 14/5`
- `Erdos153.f 6 = 74/21`
- `Erdos153.f 7 = 9/2`

The committed `receipt.json` hashes the complete ordered stream of Sidon candidates and exact energies for each cutoff, so a later Lean executor can detect any enumeration drift.

## Reproduce

From this directory:

```bash
python3 exact_values.py --write-receipt receipt.json
python3 -m unittest -v test_exact_values.py
python3 -O -m unittest -v test_exact_values.py
python3 -m py_compile exact_values.py test_exact_values.py
```

No network, floating point, randomization, third-party packages, or native code are used.

## Sponsor handoff / evidence ceiling

This is intentionally **not** represented as a sponsor-accepted contribution yet. The sponsor requires every contribution `.lean` file to elaborate by itself against the pinned Mathlib/Formal Conjectures environment; sibling contribution scripts cannot be imported. The useful finite-search theorem we compose with currently lives inside the prior immutable contribution rather than the task source. Therefore a sponsor-ready second piece must either (a) factor an admissible nonduplicative reusable interface into the sponsor's accepted source path, or (b) restate enough of the bridge in a self-contained way and pass exact `contrib check` plus Lean elaboration. This runtime has not produced that kernel receipt.

The finite enumeration itself is exact and independently reproducible. It does **not** prove the asymptotic conjecture `Filter.Tendsto Erdos153.f Filter.atTop Filter.atTop`, does not close the $4,296 solve bounty, and is not a payment/revenue claim.
