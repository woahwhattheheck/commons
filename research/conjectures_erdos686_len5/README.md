# Erdős 686 / variant “four”: length-5 reduction

This directory is a bounded, non-duplicative continuation of the three published
Conjectures.io pieces for `erdos-686-variants-four`. Those published pieces
already cover:

- `k = 2`: impossibility;
- `k = 3`: reduction to a cubic curve (plus the excluded overlap point);
- `k = 4`: impossibility.

This carrier starts at **`k = 5`**. It does not restate those lemmas.

## Exact reduction

Let

```text
P(x) = (x+1)(x+2)(x+3)(x+4)(x+5)
Q(t) = t^5 - 5t^3 + 4t.
```

Pairing factors around the center gives, over the integers,

```text
P(x)
= (x+3)((x+3)^2-1)((x+3)^2-4)
= Q(x+3).
```

Therefore the `k = 5` window equation

```text
P(m) = 4 P(n)
```

is **equivalent** to

```text
Q(m+3) = 4 Q(n+3).
```

The sponsor-side disjointness condition becomes `m >= n + 5`.

`P` is strictly increasing on nonnegative integers. Moreover

```text
P(2n+10) > 2^5 P(n) > 4 P(n),
```

because for every `i=1,...,5`, `2n+10+i > 2(n+i)`. Hence, for each fixed
`n`, an eligible `m` exists iff binary search finds it in the exhaustive integer
bracket `[n+5, 2n+10]`.

## Reproducible finite evidence

`erdos686_len5.py --limit 1000000` checks every `n` from 0 through 1,000,000
using exact Python integers. The committed receipt records:

- 1,000,001 values of `n`;
- 18,530,416 exact product comparisons;
- 0 eligible `k=5` witnesses;
- candidate-stream SHA-256
  `2ea1db918c0bc48835e03c98c67696d14d7af04e691ef3fe097a960d8a2afc68`;
- committed receipt SHA-256
  `71080b8d3cfb26097fd6127545fc93948e72fedf01e9b0f171d18173e0e2b8bc`.

The test suite cross-checks the binary-search result against brute force on a
smaller window and verifies the centered polynomial identity and the exhaustive
upper bracket.

## Evidence ceiling

This is a reusable exact algebraic reduction plus finite negative evidence.
It **does not** prove the full Erdős 686/four conjecture, and it does not prove
the `k=5` case beyond the stated finite range. `candidate.lean` is a
sponsor-shaped handoff and must not be represented as verified until it is
elaborated in the sponsor-pinned Lean environment. No bounty, payment, or
sponsor acceptance is implied by this Commons artifact.
