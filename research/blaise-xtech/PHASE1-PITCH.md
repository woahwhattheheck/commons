## Project overview

**Project Title:** SpectraPass — Point-of-Use Material Authentication for Industrial MRO

**Call to Action:** Select SpectraPass to turn Blaise into an uncertainty-aware “material passport” that helps technicians verify the right industrial material at the point of use instead of discovering a mix-up after installation.

## Problem and solution

**1. Problem Statement**  
Industrial maintenance and manufacturing teams routinely handle visually similar lubricants, adhesives, sealants, coatings, polymers, and other consumables. A mislabeled, substituted, or counterfeit material can create rework, downtime, traceability gaps, and expensive laboratory escalation. Paper labels and purchase records establish provenance, but they do not independently verify the material in the technician’s hand.

**2. Proposed Solution**  
SpectraPass pairs a Blaise Raman scan with an approved-material library for a facility or fleet. The app preprocesses a spectrum, compares it with versioned reference fingerprints, and returns one of three operational outcomes: **MATCH**, **MISMATCH**, or **INCONCLUSIVE**. The result includes calibrated confidence, nearest-reference evidence, device/sample metadata, and a QR/lot-linked audit record. An offline-first workflow keeps the core check usable where connectivity is poor. SpectraPass does not claim a material is “safe”; uncertain or out-of-distribution scans abstain and route to the organization’s existing verification process.

**3. Uniqueness and Innovation**  
The novelty is provenance-oriented AI rather than generic chemical identification. Each organization can maintain a narrow library of materials it actually authorizes. A compact spectral encoder plus similarity retrieval provides explainable nearest-reference evidence; uncertainty calibration and explicit abstention reduce false certainty. Versioned reference sets, drift checks, and lot/device metadata make every decision reproducible and auditable.

**4. Impact and Scalability**  
Initial users are industrial MRO and manufacturing teams that repeatedly verify incoming or point-of-use materials. The same workflow can extend across facilities because the application separates the reusable inference engine from organization-specific reference libraries and SOPs. A successful deployment reduces avoidable lab escalations and catches material identity mismatches before use while preserving existing quality controls.

**5. Feasibility and Technical Approach**  
Phase II would begin with a bounded reference set and a repeatable sample/scan SOP. We would collect replicate spectra across known lots and operating conditions, establish a classical similarity/PLS/SVM baseline, then compare a compact 1-D neural spectral encoder only if it improves held-out performance. The mobile client would add reference-library sync, QR/lot capture, offline inference, confidence calibration, and audit export. Validation would use lot-held-out splits and explicit unknown-material tests. No performance claim is made before Blaise hardware/data validation.

**6. Team Strength and Readiness**  
**Team:** TokenJunkieLabs / Commons. The build approach is engineering-first: versioned data pipelines, deterministic evaluation, compact AI inference, reproducible artifacts, and rapid software prototyping. Exact entrant names/contact details are `OWNER_PASTE_REQUIRED`. If selected, add a Raman/materials domain advisor before interpreting spectral performance beyond the validated task.

**7. Success Metrics**  
Phase II acceptance targets: held-out known-material identification, false-accept rate on wrong/unknown materials, confidence calibration error, abstention rate, scan-to-result latency, repeatability across replicate scans/lots, and technician task-completion time. Product metrics: verified scans per active site, percentage resolved without lab escalation, and traceable audit-record completion. Numeric targets will be frozen only after the first Blaise dataset establishes realistic baselines.

**8. Commercialization Pathway**  
Distribute the client through the supported Apple/Google app channels after SDK/hardware validation, with B2B subscriptions for site libraries, audit retention, team administration, and enterprise integrations. A concrete bottom-up **$1M ARR operating target** is 250 organizations × 4 active sites × $85/site/month = **$1.02M ARR**, before enterprise API/custom-library upsells. This is a go-to-market target, not a claim about current market size. Early customer discovery should prioritize organizations with repeated material-verification workflows and measurable rework or lab-escalation cost.
