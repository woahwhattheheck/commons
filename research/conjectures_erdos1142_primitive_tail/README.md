# Erdős 1142 primitive-root tail sieve

This carrier is a nonduplicate continuation of the published Conjectures.io contribution
“Erdős 1142: covering-congruence sieve pinning solutions to 15 mod 30 and 2145|n, with
decidability” (`8b087102…`). That piece already proves the general covering theorem and its
instances at `p = 3,5,11,13,19`, culminating in `40755 ∣ n` once
`n > 262163`.

## New mathematical content

For an odd prime `p`, the published covering theorem applies with `K = p-1` whenever `2`
is a primitive root modulo `p`: the powers `2^1,…,2^(p-1)` then hit every nonzero residue.
Consequently

`Erdos1142Prop n ∧ (2^(p-1)+p < n)  ⇒  p ∣ n`.

The exact classification of primes relevant to the Mientka–Weitzenkamp range `n ≤ 2^44`
is:

| p | ord_p(2) | threshold `2^(p-1)+p` | cumulative divisor |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 3 | 2 | 7 | 3 |
| 5 | 4 | 21 | 15 |
| 11 | 10 | 1,035 | 165 |
| 13 | 12 | 4,109 | 2,145 |
| 19 | 18 | 262,163 | 40,755 |
| **29** | **28** | **268,435,485** | **1,181,895** |
| **37** | **36** | **68,719,476,773** | **43,730,115** |

The first five rows are already owned by the published contribution. **The new rows are
`p=29` and `p=37`.** They are also the last possible direct primitive-root instances that
can affect `n≤2^44`: every prime `p≥47` has threshold `2^(p-1)+p > 2^44`, while the exact
scan of primes through 45 shows that all the other odd primes fail the required covering
condition.

Thus the published `p=19` residual can be refined piecewise:

* `4109 < n ≤ 262163`: `2145 ∣ n` — 121 candidates (published continuity row).
* `262163 < n ≤ 268435485`: `40755 ∣ n` — 6,580 candidates.
* `268435485 < n ≤ 68719476773`: `1181895 ∣ n` — 57,916 candidates.
* `68719476773 < n ≤ 2^44`: `43730115 ∣ n` — 400,718 candidates.

That leaves **465,335** arithmetic candidates in `(4109,2^44]`, versus **431,657,237**
under the published `p=19` tail alone: an exact reduction by more than 900×. This still
does **not** prove the Mientka–Weitzenkamp finite classification, because each survivor must
still be checked against every required primality condition.

## Exact executable evidence

`verify_tail.py` uses only the Python standard library. It:

1. enumerates all primes `≤45`;
2. computes the exact multiplicative order of `2 mod p`;
3. checks the complete nonzero-residue covering for every primitive-root prime;
4. records explicit least-exponent covering witnesses and SHA-256 digests;
5. checks both new thresholds and cumulative products; and
6. recomputes every piecewise residual count through `2^44`.

`receipt.json` is generated canonically from that computation. Its payload SHA-256 is:

`24f36e4f7dcb1bf81366a0fc825f81cced7a10c41b81e9bc4ba0366c81c9c4aa`

## Evidence ceiling

This is a rigorous finite-premise certificate and mathematical reduction, not a proof that
there are infinitely many Erdős-1142 numbers, not a proof of the finite classification through
`2^44`, and not a sponsor-accepted Lean contribution.
