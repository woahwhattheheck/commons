# Erdős 789: universal two-element separating subset

This is a bounded first-piece carrier for the Conjectures.io target
`Erdos789.erdos_789.variants.sq`. It does **not** prove the requested
asymptotic `h(n) = Θ(√n)`.

The source definition is:

`IsSubsetSumSeparatingCard n m` iff every `n`-element finite set `A ⊂ ℤ`
contains a finite `B ⊆ A` with `m ≤ |B|` such that equal sums of two
nonempty *subsets* of `B` have equal cardinality.

## New lemma

For every `n ≥ 3`,

`Erdos789.IsSubsetSumSeparatingCard n 2`.

Proof: let `A` have `n ≥ 3` distinct integers. At most one member of `A`
is zero, so `A` contains two distinct nonzero elements `a,b`. Put
`B={a,b}`. Its nonempty subsets are `{a}`, `{b}`, and `{a,b}`. The two
singletons have the same cardinality. If a singleton sum equalled the
two-element sum, then either `a=a+b` or `b=a+b`, forcing `b=0` or `a=0`,
contradicting the choice of `a,b`. Therefore equal nonempty subset sums
inside `B` always have equal cardinality.

This is a genuine universal structural lemma, but it is only a constant
lower bound and therefore does not close the asymptotic target.

## Exact small-n controls

The same argument plus explicit obstructions gives:

- `h(1)=1`;
- `h(2)=1`, with upper witness `A={0,1}`;
- `h(3)=2`, with upper witness `A={1,2,3}` since `1+2=3`;
- `h(4)=2`, with upper witness `A={-1,0,1,2}`. Every subset of size at
  least three either contains `0` (so adjoining `0` preserves a sum while
  changing cardinality) or is `{-1,1,2}`, where `-1+2=1`.

The executable verifier checks the separating predicate exactly on finite
sets, validates those upper witnesses, and regression-tests the canonical
two-nonzero construction over every `A ⊆ [-6,6]` of sizes 3 through 8.
The committed JSON receipt is deterministic.
