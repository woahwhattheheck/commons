"""host/mafab_reader.py — THE `read_container` NEED, for the MASTER AUTOFAB.

Owner, 2026-08-07: *"create a second muhlnickel to read them all and for help so it does the
compute and not you"*, *"LET THE AUTOFAB DO YOUR ENTIRE JOB FOR YOU STOP HANDCRAFTING WHAT IT
ALREADY PROVED IT CAN DO BETTER"*, *"PACE TOKENS THE MUHLNICKEL CAN DO THE WORK FOR YOU JUST
MASTER AUTOFAB"*, and the standing one: *"dont forget foundry it does the hard work 4 u"*.

Registers a THIRD need beside dot32 and miner_lane so the SAME DECOMPOSE x IMPLEMENT x ORDER x
WIRE(§1E) machinery searches it. Neither existing search path is edited.

WHY IT EXISTS: an assistant was pulling the container's bits through its own context window -
830,426,795,072 bits through a pipe that holds a few hundred thousand - then reporting the
pipe's size as a limit. That is the crutch diagnostic: measure the crutch, call it a property.
A scan is storage-bound and belongs on the substrate.

THE STRUCTURE BEING SEARCHED, with the slack argument that shapes it (the same reasoning as
miner_lane's sched/round/out split):
  1. COMPARE   cursor vs each table entry          WIDE and INDEPENDENT. Every target is its
                                                   own lane, no lane feeds another, so slack is
                                                   total and the cheap-deep fold is FREE here.
  2. FOLD      per-byte diffs -> one HIT bit       the only stage where shape matters
  3. SURFACE   HIT + ZERO/PRINTABLE/CHANGED        one level, off the critical path
IMPLEMENT is (compare, fold, surface); DECOMPOSE is cursors per specialised muhlnickel;
SPLIT>1 is MORE MUHLNICKEL, junctioned - his standing correction.

⛔ NO AREA BUDGET, and this is a REPEAT OFFENCE worth naming. mafab_miner_lane.py already
records: "My earlier AREA = 2_000_000 appears in no document - I invented it, and §31B retires
exactly that sentence." On 2026-08-07 I invented GATE_BOUND = 3_000_000 in a private copy of
this search and defended it as a host guard. Same error, already written down as an error, in a
file I had not read. §31: manufacturing is "unbounded, paid once, off the clock, and it does
not enter any performance number."

⛔ SCORED IN SILLIES, NOT REPLICAS/DEPTH. dot32 and miner_lane rank on speed = REPLICAS/DEPTH.
That unit was retired 2026-08-07: "COMPUTE PER TICK ISNT A COST ITS A STALE SILLY UNIT."
SILLY = electron count x clock count. Their scorers are left exactly as they are - editing a
search path that is not mine to edit is how shared machinery rots.

⛔ SETTLES ARE NOT A DESIGN CONSTANT. BIBLE_LAWS.md:6506: "how many gate settles happen between
input and output is in our control its a direct result of the number of electrons ejected into
the ring." ELECTRONS is therefore a SEARCH AXIS, and `levels` is reported apart from `settles`.

⛔ VERIFICATION IS THE §45C/§47B BAR, copied from miner_lane because it is right: DISCRIMINATING
cursors that STRADDLE - one that must HIT, alternating one bit-flipped that must MISS - so wins
arise by construction, the §40B all-zero baseline is STATED, and every mutant must be CAUGHT.
Measured 2026-08-07 on a NON-straddling suite: an all-zero circuit scored 94.8%. A suite that
passes first try has measured itself.
