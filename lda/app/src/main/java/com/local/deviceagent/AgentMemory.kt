/**
 * Small, persistent, size-capped memory the agent carries across tasks and reboots.
 * Two kinds of memory, both stored as JSON in SharedPreferences:
 *
 *  - FACTS: a key -> value map of durable user/device facts the agent should know
 *    (e.g. "phone number" -> "555-1234", "home address" -> "..."). Set explicitly
 *    ("remember my number is ...") and recalled when a task needs them.
 *  - LESSONS: a capped, de-duplicated list of short things the agent learned by doing
 *    (e.g. "Block Blast shows only a SurfaceView - play with tap_xy"). This is the
 *    bounded first step toward self-improvement from experience.
 *
 * A compact [forPrompt] block is injected into the action prompt so the model can use
 * what it knows without re-deriving it every time. Everything stays on-device.
