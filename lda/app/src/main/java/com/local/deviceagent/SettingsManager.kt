/**
 * DEFAULT-ON POSTURE (owner, 2026-07-08 — "have all of our novel features on by default, every one"). Every NOVEL
 * capability flag below (the operator/σ engine, continuous engine/stream, operator stacking/fold-verify/adaptive-
 * decode/vision-skip, startup calibration, self-calibrate, imitation, agent-language/operator-binding/light-operator,
 * passive/ambient learning, debug capture, AND the autonomous self-modification family self_improve / self_model_edit
 * / self_evolve / self_grow) now defaults to ON — the owner explicitly reversed his earlier "default OFF => byte-
 * identical" and "do NOT default self_evolve on" (§16) / "no passive monitoring by default" (§14) rules FOR HIS OWN
 * DEDICATED DEVICE, accepting the risk. Where a per-flag KDoc below still reads "Default OFF / byte-identical / A/B'd
 * before a flip," that clause is SUPERSEDED by this note — the flag ships ON; each is still an owner TOGGLE so any one
 * can be turned back off. The RAM-operator (INV-61) + the growth junk-bloat guard (INV-60) are the counterweights that
 * keep "everything on + a growing model" inside the §8 ceiling.
 *
 * WHAT STAYS OFF/protective (NOT novel features — the safety floor that makes "everything on" admissible, untouched by
 * the owner's directive): `block_code_exec` (ON), `self_protect` (ON), `policy_memory` (OFF), `risky_actions` (OFF),
 * `self_interaction` (OFF), plus the §3 executor hard gates + all kill switches, which are code, not flags. Defaulting
 * features ON never weakens these. (The `mini_model_enabled` / sub-model flag was REMOVED entirely 07-10 — single-model
 * only, §16; there is no second resident model to gate.)
