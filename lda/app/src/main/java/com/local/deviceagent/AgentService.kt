/**
 * Foreground service that owns the microphone (via Vosk) and TTS.
 *
 * A single always-on, offline Vosk recognizer does triple duty with no system
 * earcons:
 *  - IDLE: listen for the wake word ("hey agent") → capture a command.
 *  - CAPTURING: the next utterance is taken as the spoken command. The floating
 *    button (ACTION_LISTEN_NOW) jumps straight here, so push-to-speak and
 *    hands-free share one path.
 *  - BUSY: while a task runs, listen for "stop"/"cancel" so a shouted "stop"
 *    halts the agent immediately (checked on partial results for speed).
 *
 * Vosk is paused whenever the agent speaks so it never transcribes its own
 * voice (no self-triggering).
